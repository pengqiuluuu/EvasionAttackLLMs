"seven ups has been compared to bullitt for the chase scene, but does not come anywhere near matching bullitt. bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds. when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel, gets into his mustang, which is parked under the embarcadero freeway ( now torn down ) and notices the charger sitting nearbye, you know you are about to see something spectacular. from that moment on, when mcqueen starts that car, begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed. adding to it is a terrific lalo schriffin if i remember correctly sound track. this goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing. that shot of mcqueen's mustang suddenly appearing in bill hickman's rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact. hickman's look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect. then of course, san francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends. also, bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still "" hot "" ( mustang gt and dodge charger ) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog device laden pontiacs in the 1970s seven ups. bill hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies. i saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when i was doing movie reviews for a paper. they gave it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene. seven ups had a few "" jumps "" over little hills, ( yawn ) but of course they were not san francisco hills. the seven ups chase, where they are actually going fast, is longer than the go fast sequence in bullitt. but the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy schieders pontiac is the height of absurdity. strictly hollywood, i would say, except that it was filmed in new york.",1,0
"crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because, unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman's agreement, which it beat to theatres by a few months, it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying "" it's because i'm jewish, isn't it? "" it's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical. somewhat shamefully, the brief featurette on the warners'dvd doesn't mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti - semitic one, but it's interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish, there's little doubt in sam levene's performance that the character is in fact also gay not a mincing caricature, but there's definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george cooper's confused soldier. there's not much of a mystery to who the murderer is : even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows, the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable, but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point : the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy. < br / > < br / > there's an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix ( you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for hue and cry ), but the atmosphere is pure rko noir. set over one long sweltering night, the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style ( it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actors ) and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script : a laid - back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum, robert young's maigret - like detective, gloria grahame's tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer, a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties. but the lasting impression is of robert ryan's excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row. a big surprise hit in 1946, as",1,1
"i saw the movie "" hoot "" and then i immediately decided to comment it. the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet. some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want to, which probably is like, but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful! this movie is not just about kids, this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do. when i was twelve, i saw some waterlilies and i knew they are protected by law and didn't even dare to touch them not fearing of the law, but fearing that i might harm them actually.

"ye lou's film purple butterfly pits a secret organization ( purple butterfly ) against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai. ding hui ( zhang ziyi ) and her ex - lover hidehiko itami ( toru nakamura ) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting. < br / > < br / > i agree with the reviewer from paris. the film substitutes a convoluted, semi - historical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. the sudden time shifting doesn't help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. normally i don't mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the bone - jarringly shaky camera footage, and the generally bad film - making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film "" has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography "", but i don't think that helps the movie. the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century, and i don't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film. the overly melodramatic moments don't add to its watchability. < br / > < br / > the actors are all suitably melancholy. zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, brooding and looking generally annoyed. however, at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love - making scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator. < br / > < br / > all in all, a very disappointing film, especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he. 2 / 10",0,1

"first, let me just comment on what i liked about the movie. the special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game. there, that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film. in fact, i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. < br / > < br / > i have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the "" plot twist "" ( if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away ) where lois's 5 year - old son turns out to be the super - powered child of superman. when the crying super - child throws a piano at lex's henchman to save his mother, i almost got up and left the theater. singer could have made a much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super - powered illegitimate child. it's been 5 days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit. < br / > < br / > my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. it doesn't take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what's wrong with that. i don't know how many comic books brian singer has read, but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman - related projects ever again. the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. why not just have superman eat kryptonite? he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. that's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re - entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. < br / > < br / > my third major complaint has to do",0,0

"if you've read mother night and enjoyed it so much ( as i did ) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut's writing - that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself, and that you can't put a human mind on the screen. his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance. i believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. does this mean that the movie misses the mark? of course not. in my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book ( this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page ). it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america's true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. i've seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft. i would not place this movie as one of the best i've seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. by taking vonnegut's "" voice "" out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can, mother night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.",1,1

"if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. it's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match - ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles. as evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. to get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. i know, i know, that's hard to do when you consider custer's last stand at the little big horn and it's prominence in the history of post civil war america. so i guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it. < br / > < br / > there's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. custer's arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. the practical joke by sharp ( arthur kennedy ) putting him up in the major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble. < br / > < br / > ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in custer's first meeting with libby bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie ( hattie mcdaniel ). i hadn't noticed it before in other films, but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties, mantan moreland. so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress. with that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too. < br / > < br / > as for flynn, it's interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed j. e. b. stuart opposite ronald reagan's depiction of general custer in "" santa fe trail "", both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland. in that film, reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers, while in flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident. but it doesn't come close to that of richard mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's "" little big man "". let",1,1

"the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. it's peak years were between 1968 and 1972. one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle, who had a small but fanatic cult of followers. she was actually able to act, unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks, and her subsequent credits proved it. and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique. < br / > < br / > gary graver, the director, was also a talent ; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre, and his skill, combined with monica gayle's screen presence, makes sandra, the making of a woman, a pleasantly enjoyable experience. the film never drags and you won't have your finger pressed on the fast - forward button.",1,1

"ab tak chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in mumbai, india. sadhu agashe is a hard working, hard - edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison. his loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers, imtiaz, becomes frustrated by sadhu's high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status. a new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and imtiaz is angry when sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case. further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of sadhu's tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics. < br / > < br / > i was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from india. the camera work is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. the acting, pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood, sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director, shimit amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts. nevertheless, ab tak chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film - making.",1,1

"i know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless ; i was, at first, a little sceptical about the plot of this movie. it follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion, and thus ( naturally ) become ruthless serial killers. the plot does sound ridiculous at first, but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out saturn and, as you know, saturn is the emotion planet, it all falls into place ; makes complete sense and it's then that you know you aren't simply watching another silly 80's slasher with a pea brain plot. thank god for that! seriously, though, bloody birthday is based on a ridiculous premise, but it more than makes up for that with it's originality. having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema, but when given the choice between this and another dull friday the 13th clone - i know what i'd choose. < br / > < br / > also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it's silly plot dug it into is the fact that it's extremely entertaining. many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore. this film, however, keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids ( which harks back to creepy kid classics such as village of the damned ), a constant stream of sick humour and a small, but impressive for the type of film, dose of suspense and tension. one thing that i liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry. there's nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again ( cough halloween cough ), but that's not the case here as bloody birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows. there wasn't any room for a chainsaw, which is a huge shame, but i suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it.",1,0

"" this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence, redundant clips from the hotd video game, and sloppy matrix - esque camera rotations. one of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. why? not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!? < br / > < br / > to sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is. the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and i'm sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh * t could easily cover the costs it took to make it. grade : f",0,0
"another spanish movie about the 1936 civil war. this time we're told about the story of carol ( lovely played by debutant clara lago ), a little girl which comes to live to a little spanish village from new york. it is such an initiating trip, and soon she'll find about the injustices of the human race, their stupid fights and conflicts, their contradictions. < br / > < br / > imanol uribe makes his best film since "" dias contados "" ( 1994 ) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photography, and a nice script. he tries not to take part in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and let us decide ( ok, the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in ) and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple : clara lago and juan jose ballesta. < br / > < br / > a well cared production. < br / > < br / > my rate : 7 / 10",1,1
"if somebody wants to make a really, really bad movie, "" wizards of the lost kingdom "" really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness. < br / > < br / > start with the pseudo - chewbacca that follows around the main character... some poor schmuck in a baggy white "" furry "" costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting. work your way slowly, painfully, through more not - so - special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief. add a garden gnome ( just for the heck of it ). < br / > < br / > on second thought, skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half.",0,0
"an extremely down - to - earth, well made and acted "" rodeo "" western. no gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's west. but hats off particularly to slim pickens for giving what i think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. his role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the "" ups and downs "" of the hard - nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style. he and mr. coburn teamed up extremely well as partners, not only on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the corral. also, check out anne archer as coburn's native american love interest in the latter part of the movie. must have been one of her first roles. < br / > < br / > not as flashy, perhaps, as "" junior bonner "", but equally heart rendering and impacting in its portrayal. thanks to the encore western channel for showing this true grit of an under - rated movie from time to time.",1,1
if you watched pulp fiction don't see this movie. this movie is not funny. this is the worst parody movie ever. this is a poor attempt of parody films. < br / > < br / > the cast is bad. the film is bad. this is one of the worst pictures ever made. < br / > < br / > i do not recommend plump fiction. i prefer the original pulp fiction by the great quentin tarantino. this is one of the worst parody films ever made. < br / > < br / > plump fiction is not a good movie. it is not funny. it is so dumb and vulgar.,0,0
"relentless like one of those loud action movies. the entire cast seems to be on speed. i didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. i wonder if she's ever seen a stanley donen, vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical. structure, please! this is one hell of a mess and i loved abba. the costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations ) the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making a fool of herself. no chemistry with her friends ( christine baranski and julie walters ) think of streep with lily tomlyn in the altman film and you'll understand what i was hoping for. i was embarrassed in particular by pierce brosnam and colin firth. the audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me.",0,1
""" down periscope "" has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs. since then, we have acquired the dvd and a digital from cinema now. < br / > < br / > it is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. it is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, i am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered. < br / > < br / > the movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. i became aware of this while visiting the uss drum in mobile, alabama in 2002. a group of cub scouts, my grandson among them, had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board. < br / > < br / > it is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our navy and hollywood... which is rare company. < br / > < br / > thanks to kelsey grammar, lauren holly and rob schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie, such great entertainment!",1,1
"wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me? nothing other than a questionable "" sequel "" to 8mm. it wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie. < br / > < br / > basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an american diplomat, david huxley, and his fiancee, tish harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest, hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, risa. the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. the mystery is solved when, in the end, tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and ( essentially later on in the story ) her fiancee which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end. < br / > < br / > i didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8mm at all. the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. otherwise, its a totally different movie. it made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didn't believe the words coming out of david's mouth the whole time. but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble. < br / > < br / > there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the "" shocking "" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this "" hellish "" sex debauchery. i counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative. < br / > < br / > david was no heroic person throughout the film. you could guess he was the main problem long before the end. the",0,0
