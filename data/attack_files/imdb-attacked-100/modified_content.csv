i love to watch this movie a lot because of all hollywood the scary scenes about the raptors. i like raptors because they are scary. my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the rules 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana. < br / > < br / > i really love to watch a lot of this children movie because the computer graphics scouts seem a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it's got a good ending even though i didn't really lurking understand what was going on on my first couple emotions viewings i daly figured it out over time los angeles and french that's the important part. the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you're watching it the first time. < br / > < br / cuban > this is best movie.

"despite donald martin ran some reviews being distinctly luke - warm, i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as'mills and boon ', so what? it is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in fargo these cynical times. many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously islands dabbing their eyes. you really believe that things the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it destined was an arranged marriage. i did feel though that sir john conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. as it is meredith rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of victoria ( as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent ) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess, trapped in the stifling palace improvements with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that tracks eventually made victoria a great queen makes of england, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. i believe word chris elliot of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie."

"this is a very memorable spaghetti western. it has a great storyline, interesting characters, and touches some very beverly good acting, especially from rosalba neri. her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. she steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. her performance is very believable. she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top ( not that there's anything wrong with being over the top ). mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. < br / > < br / > the music score is excellent, and remaining the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want stars it to or not. there are a couple of parts that are very amusing. i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot. there's also lots of slick gun - play that's very well done. < br / > < br / > i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about layers 25 minutes into the film. this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie. it is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill / bud spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really knows needed to be more realistic. the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma's cowardly australian mexican adaptations sidekick. i kris guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and expectations he wasn't at all funny. all i can say is where is tuco when you need him? < br / > < br / > all that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie."
"man with the screaming brain mainstream certainly isn't a perfect movie, but i'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career : slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, makes and happy endings. campbell is, as a writer, uneven - - there are lots of things in the story that don't make christmas day a great deal of sense ( why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it? ), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations ( the scene in the restaurant, where yegor and william battle for control of william's body, is straight out of evil dead ii ). there are, however, lots of little touches and non - sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when william is emotions in the height of his panic and screams at a statue, "" what are you looking at?! "" the movie looks like a sci - fi channel original, probably because it was. the acting is sucked actually pretty good. i particularly enjoyed tamara gorski as tatoya ; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, compared but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. ted raimi handled the standard "" bumbling assistant "" role admirably enough, and bruce is funny as the jamie lynn arrogant, sardonic, condescending american jerk. ( now that he's writing his own films, you'd think he'd scouts give himself arguing a role that he islands hasn't been typecast in already. ) man with the screaming brain is a bizarre, nonsensical b - movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously."

"emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel. i have not read the book so i really didn't know that much about the plot, and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot. there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved fails it. of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority actors was well acted and funny. gwyneth paltrow gives one australia of her best performances as the heroine in expectations emma. the film also stars toni collette ( who has okay but has been much better ) ewan mecgreger ( who has also been better but he is hoping still very good here ) alan cumming ( who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty compared much pacing swearing the same here ) and jeremy northam ( who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle, even if that was not what it needed ) there british have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth reminds watching."

"this is australia apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. and, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, a yank at oxford. both films concern a conceited blow - hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and alabama group cub both, ultimately, show the blow - hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency. in this film, william haines is "" tom brown "" and his main rival, "" bob "" is played by frances x. jessie bushman. and, in a supporting role is jack pickford - - always remembered as the brother of mary. of these three, pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom's pal - - he actually has a few decent scenes as chris elliot well as a dramatic moment just before the big game! all the standard cliches are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises. however, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing. < br / > < br / > in my opinion, for a better silent college film, try harold lloyd's the freshman - - it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and expectations harold children is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown. the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era. another pacing reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character sucked with the same plot again and again and again ( such as in westpoint and the smart set, among others ) - - and if moore you've seen one of these films, you've seen them all. well made, but certainly hollywood not original! and, because it is just a rehash of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films. < br / > < br / > 4 / 25 / 08 = = i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920!! talk about over - rated! there are dozens and dozens of better films - - how this film got to be # 1 is anyone's guess."
