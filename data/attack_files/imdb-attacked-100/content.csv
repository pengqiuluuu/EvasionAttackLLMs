"the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend. her aunt ( edna may oliver - - a person too talented for this film ) didn't like wheeler - - a sentiment i can easily relate to. the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler. they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. at about the same time, woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. so when wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends - - which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime. < br / > < br / > i am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood - - the silent era through the 1940s. i have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolsey - - the only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers! despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood ( cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey ), i can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. for example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother's film, duck soup, yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. at times, woolsey talked a bit like groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! in fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. his only funny quality was that he looked goofy - - surely not enough reason to put him on film. additionally, wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese - - a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as "" who's on first "" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. in fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine - - so prematurely that you are left frustrated. i knew that "" who's on first "" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist. < br"
"if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, anything is better than this movie. it is slow paced, confusing, boring, poorly constructed, gory, gringy, do i need to go on? it's message is good, but i have seen them been handled better in several other films. the acting isn't even any good. this movie is just even more awkward, as it start off as being funny ( not intensional though ) because of it's surreal story, than at the end, just becomes uncomfortable to watch. < br / > < br / > i honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed. why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes, than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear, witness a sort of rape, than see the female lead role eat her husband. < br / > < br / > honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 1 / 10. and if your not happy with my preview, seriously i'm an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was just awful. make any excuse you can, to avoid this film."

"based on a edgar rice burroughs novel, at the earth's core provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest. a victorian scientist dr. abner perry ( peter cushing ) invents a giant burrowing machine, which he and his american partner ( doug mcclure ) use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold. they soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monsters. < br / > < br / > cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying. instead of being a bold adventurer, he comes across effeminate. on the other hand mcclure overacted enough to make himself also laughable. caroline munro plays the pretty princess dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. also in the cast are : godfrey james, cy grant and michael crane."
"we brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could of been our worst joke to play. the film is barely watchable, and the acting is dire. the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable. < br / > < br / > just terrible"
"this movie was way over - hyped. a lot of the viewers, who thought this was "" amazing "" must have been into the old school movies, cause the whole movie is set in the past. at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past, so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass, but it just going. basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past, and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with. there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying "" it's the greatest movie ever done "". it's just crap on a stick. it also didn't help that the story line was sooo crappy. i don't understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced, and i also don't understand how actors / actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this. it's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print... "" it will all be done on a computer "". this was a movie that should have been on a movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. i'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this. whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow."
"i have just given a 10 for thieves highway, i mention this for two reasons one to prove i'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night. < br / > < br / > we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. pretty woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. my feeling is this'happy hooker'type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. < br / > < br / > secondly,'pretty woman'insults romance itself, edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this'lady'that is without his plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please. < br / > < br / > girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. guys who like this film will not even have"
"originally harped as a sequel to "" the slumber party massacre "" series, this film falls flat on it's face with a new title. first off, if you are going to include the word "" massacre "" in your film's title, you better deliver. this one certainly does not. there is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box art would lead you to believe. instead, we get a paper thin, overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be offed one by one. again, this film could have been ok if the gore quotient was upped a bit. why directors, especially those doing direct - to - video flicks, are afraid to show any gore is beyond me. now, i am not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on... why else would anyone rent a movie called "" cheerleader massacre?? "" besides that problem, the film suffers from a shot - on - a - home - video - camera cheapness. it looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors aren't all that good. it tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be, but even that fails. the ending ends up being a ridiculous mess. folks, if you run across this film, walk away and go find the original "" slumber party massacre. "" 2 out of 10."
"what a horrible, horrible film. the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time. not that i saw much. i left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. meryl streep was awful as usual. how many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have? aidan quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted. and who told gloria estefan she could act? trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. ( brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school ). the kids weren't even cute! just written in to suit the appalling script. aaargh! wes craven really made me cringe for once. real horror this one!"
"phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines. < br / > < br / > at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn't find the jokes or oddness funny anymore. < br / > < br / > its a low budget film ( thats never a problem in itself ), there were some pretty interesting characters, but eventually i just lost interest. < br / > < br / > i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking. < br / > < br / > for something similar but better try "" brother from another planet """
"the story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies. ri'chard is great. he really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. seriously, i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile. i can't say anything bad about peter galleghar. he's one of my favorite actors. i love anne rice. i'm currently reading the vampire chronicles, but i'm glad i saw the movie before reading the book. this is a little too "" real "" for me. i prefer lestat and louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me ; i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. ( sorry for the ambiguity, but i don't want to give anything away ) sorry, but it's just not my type of show."
"the premise of this movie was decent enough, but with sub par acting, it was just bland and dull. < br / > < br / > spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death, it was accidental, so although it was a murder it wasn't like the guy set out to do it. also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree. there is no emotion in this film. the first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister, and hearing her message. it was dull and boring. < br / > < br / > with some polishing, and better acting it could have been pretty good."
"ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented failings. this however was the worst film i have seen since demons at the door. compared to datd the effects are vastly superior. however the plot is weak, the acting reminiscent of everyone's favourite, the porn film, and the decisions and actions of the "" characters "" consistently verge on the moronic. i feel like trying out uwe boll's latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over hotd2. i am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up. ok there it is. i have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead 2."
"a very ordinary made - for - tv product, "" tyson "" attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect, fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing, and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes tyson even remotely interesting. a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans."
"as usual, i am making a mad dash to see the movies i haven't watched yet in anticipation of the oscars. i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley. i can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has. there is no story!! a group of guys meander around iraq. one day they are here diffusing a bomb. tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside, by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire. no wait here they are back in bagdad. there is no cohesive story at all. the three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures. by that i mean, we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying. we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe. and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers dvds. what do you think is going to happen??? well, do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways?? why yes! do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy? why yes! there is no story here. the script is juvenile and predictable! the camera is shaken around a lot to make it look "" artsy "". and for all of you who think this is such a great war picture, go rent "" full metal jacket "", "" deerhunter "" or "" platoon "". don't waste time or money on this boring movie!"

"i was really hoping that this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever preview clips. and talk about hype, i even heard an interview with the show's creator on the bbc world today - a show that is broadcast all over the world. < br / > < br / > unfortunately, this show doesn't even come close to delivering. all of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. all of the characters are one - dimensional. the acting is - well - mediocre ( i'm being nice ). it's the classic cbc recipe - one that always fails. < br / > < br / > if you're muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted, ignorant, or both. not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that. it's only a problem when it isn't funny - as in this show. < br / > < br / > canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis. so how come the producers of this show couldn't find any?"
"oh god, i must have seen this when i was only 11 or twelve, ( don't ask how ) i may have been young, but i wasn't stupid. anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. i've seen more impressive effects at disneyland, i've seen better performances at a school play, and i've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass. < br / > < br / > the story is set in northern australia. a handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. after they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family. < br / > < br / > i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is lake placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think, with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind. < br / > < br / > the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life. unless you really want to see it, avoid blood surf."
"i'm stunned that the reviewers @ imdb gave this tv film as a high a rating as they did. it's an innocuous, sweet, uncomplicated cliche'of a film that had two big names from the past in it ( both of whom did a decent job ), but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels. i like a good romance as well as anyone, but as my wife and i were watching this - - and before we saw the rating - we said, "" there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there's nothing in it to challenge their brains, their faith, their comfort level or their cultural preferences. it's possible to make a good film like that ( and away from her is an example ), but this was amateur hour. there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one. truly, another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films. watch the family stone. it's miles ahead of this schlock."
"the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. of course it's not going to be an oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes. < br / > < br / > the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. it's just them fighting back throughout the whole film, which includes a lot of violence ( which is basically the whole film ) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing, and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience. < br / > < br / > i'd give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that only. although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on, as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake. the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment, something to pass time if you're bored, and nothing else. < br / > < br / > 4 / 10"
"nicholas walker is paul, the local town reverand who's married to martha ( ally sheedy ), but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair, veronica ( dara tomanovich ). however in so doing, he gets a bout of amnesia ( hence the name of the film ). sally kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good reverand in a shades of "" misery "" type of way. it's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. in a film billed as a'black comedy ', one has to bring both elements into said movie. while this does bring the former in spades, it sadly contains none of the latter. furthermore you can't emphasize with any of the characters and as thus, have absolutely no vested interest in them. technically not an all - together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one. < br / > < br / > eye candy : dara tomanovich gets topless ; sally kirkland also shows some skin < br / > < br / > my grade : c - < br / > < br / > where i saw it : showtime showcase"
"note to self. never ever ever again watch a serious movie with charlie sheen in it. great comedian, horrible seal. this movie makes navy seals look like a reckless group of rangers when, in fact, they are the most elite form of military in the world. charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation. thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies i have ever seen. this is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie, but why charlie sheen? there are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but sheen decides to wreck them with "" funny "" comments."
"this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. the writer obviously bought the playbook "" how to write a space disaster movie "" and followed it play by play. in particular, the stereo - typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again. < br / > < br / > max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $ 50 million at the project. but, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $ 50 thousand. to learn that the film was nominated for a "" special visual effects "" emmy has me absolutely gob - smacked. < br / > < br / > i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects! < br / > < br / > and the plot holes are too numerous to mention. but i will pick one out as an example. now, i'm no nasa expert, but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear - shaped with the program. surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty - nine year old who has not been in the control room before. < br / > < br / > the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell. he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script. < br / > < br / > i give this film 2 out of 10, with the above - average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark."

"in all honesty, i haven't seen this film for many years, but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory, as anyone who has seen it will understand. i first saw it as a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixties, and it scared the hell out of us kids, in a fun way. i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. i can't risk giving away the ending, except to say that it was surprising, to say the least. i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler, followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history, and yet oddly moving, in a way. you have to see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. i don't know if it's available on home video or not, but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults."
"had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix, i'd have a couple of hours of my life back. i'm frankly suspicious when i see that a film's director also wrote it. in this case, according to the credits, the same guy was "" writter and director "" - unfortunately, an indication of the overall quality of this production. there were a few interesting moments ( e. g., judy tenuta's scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judy - ism ) which led me to rate this two stars rather than one. those moments, however, were few and far between... and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me, not to mention reprehensible in its violence. i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once i'd seen the whole thing. nope, though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later. the "" spinning camera "" technique was overused and essentially pointless. i found myself talking to the tv screen : "" what?!? "" or "" for goodness sake, get on with it! "" not recommended."

"caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason, while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield. ty webb is funny, being the only character from the original. most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original ( henry wilcoxon for example ) except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt, being played by randy quaid. every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office ( i don't go in for law suits or motions. i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f * * * ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale, maybe roast that golden retriever ( arff arff arff ) then eat it. and then i'm comin'upstairs junior, and i'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a * *! do we have an understanding? ). offsetting his small role however, is dan acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for bill murray. his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. overall caddyshack ii is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it."

"i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience. in other words - the creators planed to make comedy not drama. howsoever, at the end i realized that mr. tony giglio was earnest about this movie. it's a pity because : the dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fishy tale! poor ryan phillippe - despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance! what to say for jason statham - lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction... for this reasons i vote : 3 / 10"
"okay this is stupid, they say their not making another nightmare film, that this is the "" last "" one... and what do they do? they go on making another one, not that the next one ( part7 ) was bad, but why do they play us. anyway this movie made no sense what - so ever, it was extremelly dull, the characters were highly one dimensional, freddy was another joker, which is very stupid for such a good series. the plot is very, very bad, and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. i didnt get the movie, its a stupid tale in 3 - d, pointless! id say. i hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film. this is so different than the prequels, it tries, and tries, but this one tried the hardest, and got slapped back on the face. again there were hadly any death scenes, although they were different, they sucked bigtime. how can they have gone this far? didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5? yet they make this? its all bout the money, do not see this sad excuse for a nightmare series. < br / > < br / > i gave a nightmare on elm street six ( 6 ) 3 out of 10. < br / > < br / > good points of movie : had potential with plot. < br / > < br / > bad points of film : terrible acting / lack of deaths / too funny to be classified as horror / very confusing."
"today, i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood. < br / > < br / > hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 changed everything. it changed our perception of security. it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. most importantly and devastatingly, it changed our world. < br / > < br / > however, i can't not stress how utterly repulsed, disillusioned, and angry i am at the careless, blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word - of - mouth among moviegoers and critics alike ; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. hollywood has sunk to a new low. even lower than the low - down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. behind it all is uwe boll. i am very angry at this movie. how dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost? how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post - 911 world?!?!?! how... dare... they? < br / > < br / > to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty, i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength : remember. think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. think back to that day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones. think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes. think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks. < br / > < br / > ask yourself if you have a soul. < br / > < br / > think. remember. respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all."

"this is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. everything about it - - acting, directing, script, cinematography - - is dreadful. the alien ( a human in sparkly suit ) claims to be from a nearby universe ; one assumes the scriptwriter meant "" galaxy "" but didn't bother to get a dictionary to check his terms. a better title for the film would be "" it came from the planet of plot contrivances. "" the plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent. the humans are all given magical macguffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot. any thought to the passage of time is ignored. now it's a couple days after meeting the alien, then bam! all of a sudden there's only a couple hours left until zero hour. do yourself a favor and miss this movie. you will make yourself stupider for having watched it. the ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone going "" ta - da!!!! "" as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt. i think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you'll get cancer watching it. if you can watch the last 10 minutes without crapping yourself ( "" enemies of freedom "" - - honestly ) laughing, you're retarded."

"so i rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger ebert's book "" i hated, hated, hated this movie "" and he gave this one a rare zero - star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review "" mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor "". so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. i know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since ebert's review of rob reiner's "" north "" where he said he hated that movie ten times had i ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. here we have richard dreyfuss as a gangster which i don't think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. but above all the other things that were awful about this "" movie "" i can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss's girlfriend while dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. but after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill. haha. not funny. then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra's "" my way "" sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss. of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die. are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? i can certainly tell you i did not care or find that funny. not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss ( who i admire much as an actor ) for producing and starring in this tripe but i am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that "" independence day "" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. did goldblum feel that "" independence day "" would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him"
"this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. i wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end. if you don't want to know much about the plot, don't keep reading. < br / > < br / > gilbert's character, ophelia, is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. brad johnson, also an excellent actor, is matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. he is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role. < br / > < br / > the two meet on the beach through her daughter, pip, and initially, ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. < br / > < br / > the chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. i wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell. < br / > < br / > i wanted mindless entertainment, and i got it with this. in regard to the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable.

"what happened? what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. actually, it never really got going. there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. steve martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, kate and angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot."
"while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring, star trek the final frontier is plain bad. in this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth, romulus and kronos ( the klingon home world ) have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. there, he hopes to find god. using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship. they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god - like alien. this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. at the core is a good idea that is never really developed. the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. the action scenes don't have the suspense of wrath of kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner. when he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. most of the focus is on him, spock, and mccoy, but does not give the others enough to do. moreover, whereas shatner is usually guilty of over - acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. now kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, "" row row row your boat "" in a round by a campfire. in any case, this is the worst of the star trek franchise. i should have given it three out of ten instead of five."
"weak, stale, tired, cliched ; wants to be basic instinct, but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives, new insights. insipid, trite, grotesque, and without the possibly - redeeming value of brevity ; oh, wait... it was only 90 minutes long... it must have just * seemed * a lot longer! i'd rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again. i'm expressing an opinion here : i guess this means i didn't like it."
"have you ever heard the saying that people "" telegraph their intentions? "" well in this movie, the characters'actions do more than telegraph future plans - - they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head. this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. embeth davidtz's character is not mysterious, just wooden, and kenneth branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have. < br / > < br / > the bottom line : obvious plot, one - note performances, unlikeable characters, and grotesque "" southern "" accents employed by british actors."

"this movie is lame and not funny at all. the plot doesn't even make sense. some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension ( maybe hell??? ) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit ( i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her? ) the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book ( they want to be witches or something??? ) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. i'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either. the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. who are these people and what are they doing? basically this is a go - camping - to - make - out - then - fight - a - monster movie but there are a bunch of things ( like the other dimension and book seller ) than make it confusing. i didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal. i don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, i can't think of any part of the movie that was good."

"i think my summary says it all. this mtv - ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x ( or is that gen y ) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. example : kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his "" wedding. "" kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. the "" joke "" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his "" bits and pieces. "" problem is, this schtick goes on way too long, obviously to fill out time. and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one, running around, constantly asking "" do i look fat? "" i recognize the show was not made for me. it was made for 12 - year - old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today. so let them laugh. thank god the show was short - lived."
"i have now seen quite a few films by pedro almodovar, but this would have to be the most disappointing so far. this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story just never got me interested. many almodovar regulars appear in this film, so it's not like there was a lack of on - screen talent, but this film just seemed more serious than his other films. if there was a comedic edge to this movie, i certainly couldn't find it, and it made for one surprisingly weak movie."

what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel. i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original. this version is no different. i felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever... anyway back to this version. it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style. it succeeds in both but high art it is nit. throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe... the direction was average and the editing abysmal. worse than the old quincy. deepak verma does a great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents. the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project. although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had. its clear that he was a director for hire and didn't instill the project with the passion that it deserved.

"i caught this film on azn on cable. it sounded like it would be a good film, a japanese "" green card "". i can't say i've ever disliked an asian film, quite the contrary. some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean, and i am a huge fan of john woo's hong kong films. i an not adverse to a light hearted films, like tampopo or chung king express ( two of my favourites ), so i thought i would like this. well, i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious, badly acted film ever again. < br / > < br / > i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude, because no one in this film had a personality. and when any of the characters did try to act, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake. i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before... the only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki.. i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy, because i didn't laugh once. even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this "" a refreshing breath of comedy "". it was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. and the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things. < br / > < br / > avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting. i actually think that "" spike of bensonhurst "" is a better acted film than this... and i walked out half way through that film!"
"i never fell asleep during a movie. never. this movie did the impossible. < br / > < br / > while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror films over their american counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. as in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. it would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. the acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad - lib something called a script. did these people even get any direction? were they coaxed to be boring and dull? either therory wouldn't surprise me. < br / > < br / > what was even worse was the rather unscary make - up involved with the creatures from the other side. either way, they all stunk. don't watch this film. that's all i can say ( unless you're an insomniac )."
"this movie was terrible. the plot was terrible and unbelievable. i cannot recommend this movie. where did this movie come from? this movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including : gary sinise, kathy bates, joey lauren adams, and jennifer tilly."
"busty beauty stacie randall plays pvc clad, bad - ass bitch alexandra, the faithful acolyte of faust, an evil entity trapped in hell. determined to free her master, the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success ; but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon faust, the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor, which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive, troll - like creatures called lite and dark. < br / > < br / > now alexandra must find a replacement gem, which isn't going to be easy : the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex - lover, police detective jonathan graves ( peter liapis ), who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil alexandra is capable of. meanwhile, wise - cracking inter - dimensional half - pints lite and dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home. < br / > < br / > in the warped movie world of jim wynorski, all females are big - breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker. ghoulies iv is no exception : every woman in this filmwhether she be a police captain, a curator of antiquities, or a mental patient in an asylumis hot, hot, hot and wears not a lot, and it's this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of stv crap just about bearable. < br / > < br / > but be warned, even though the presence of semi - naked, quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier, there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal : the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful ; the black humour ( as the dvd blurb describes it ) is about as funny as a knee to the knackers, with the comedic banter of lite and dark being particularly cringe - worthy ; and the special effects are bargain basement, consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years earlier. < br / > < br / > 3 / 10 solely for the high bimbo quotient."
"what a frustrating movie. a small southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces, as anyone who has read anything by carson mccullers already knows. this does none of that. instead, the writers settled for cutesy twinkles, cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama. the thing looks like a made - for - tv movie, and was directed with no particular distinction, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting. < br / > < br / > the most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast, all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with this - - well, there's no other word for it - - drivel. a tragic waste of talent, in particular that of the great stockard channing."
"the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie. < br / > < br / > it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache. < br / > < br / > i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies."
"how do you take a cast of experienced, well - known actors, and put together such a stupid movie? nimrod antel has the answer : armored. six co - workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves. but, just as they get to first base with their plans, everything unravels quickly. with a plot like this, you'd think it couldn't be too bad, at least for an action movie. however, in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal, everyday kind of guys. they joke, they laugh, have a few drinks together, etc. then, we suddenly learn they're planning to rob their own business. the hero ty, ( columbus short ), is sucked into the scheme because of the cold, cruel world, even though he's a decorated veteran, nice guy, and reliable employee. oh my, oh my! then in the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular guys nearly all turn into money - crazed psychos, willing to butcher each other for cash. in the last scenes mike, ( matt dillon ), goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. the viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty. it's utterly unbelievable and "" b movie "" is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot. i would say don't waste your time - - too bad no one gave laurence fishburne, jean reno or fred ward the same advice before making this picture."
"all the way though i was thinking to myself "" oh god why! "" at the very beginning i thought "" right it might be average, "" but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious. < br / > < br / > every part in it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring, it was a half decent movie, but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible. some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, eg. the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches. my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right. < br / > < br / > why does going into the house make her come after you, it doesn't make sense. it was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all. < br / > < br / > you can see everything coming, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. oh shes behind her... didn't see that one coming * yawns *. < br / > < br / > surely these people must have thought to... oh i don't know, carry a knife round or at least try and fight back, instead of being eaten but someone hair? at best during the movie i was very mildly scared ( and i mean mildly ), i was just crying out for the credits, as they rolled i exhaled a short "" oh thank god.

"this is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 ( the national film preservation foundation says 1969 and imdb says 1972 ). regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period - - with some camera - work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s - early 70s. < br / > < br / > the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. the film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and "" with it "" to be understood by us mortals."
"no mention if ann rivers siddons adapted the material for "" the house next door "" from her 1970s novel of the same title, or someone else did it. this lifetime - like movie was directed by canadian director jeff woolnough. having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. you know that when the critical moments precede the commercials, which of course, one can't find in this version we watched. < br / > < br / > the film's star is lara flynn boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. from the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, ms. boyle is hardly recognizable as col kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. this was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera. that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actors that deserved better. < br / > < br / > the film has a feeling of a cross between "" desperate houswives "" with "" the stepford wives "" and other better known features, combined with a mild dose of creepiness. the best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting."

"i saw this movie in the middle of the night, when i was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch. it's one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off, no matter how bad it is. one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's, well, just plain bad, it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both! great middle - of - the - night fare, if only for the fabulous tennis drag. don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply."
"maybe it was the title, or the trailer ( certainly not the interview on the dvd, which is with the director as he keeps saying "" hi, kids "" into the camera like a buffoon ), but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal, bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator. turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. there's a problem - and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust, similar to this in many respects - in not having balance to the sex and violence. too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! and with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature / killer / whatever. entrails of a virgin has neither. it's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie, even if isn't one of the very worst ever made - it's there just for horn - dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their'other'heads. < br / > < br / > in this case, we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by "" a murderer "" as he's credited. first off, the director kazuo'gaira'komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on - we get spliced in ( or phoned in, take your pick ) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. it looks like it's from another movie. then once settled into the house, there's a'wrestling'scene that's poorly choreographed and shot ( yeah, we really need to see him'all'there ), and then on to the rape and killings. first the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. then the murderer, who like d'amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial"
"ken burns'"" baseball "" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes. there's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws. < br / > < br / > 18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. it's clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his "" nine inning "" concept. it's not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful. isn't baseball ever exciting and fun? why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy? talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, yakking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball as americana, the psychology and theology of baseball... enough! this is syrupy, mawkish drivel. billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum he's sold us before. ken burns uses the national anthem as the series'theme song, and manages to play "" take me out to the ballgame "" so many times you might vomit. we get it, dude. < br / > < br / > clearly burns is a neo - hollywood faux - liberal, so he spends probably a third of the film on the negro leagues... these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open - minded as kenny is today. for shame! he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times! burns falls head over heels in love with buck o'neil, a former negro - league player, and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly o'neil waxes poetic about his playing days. nonsense... < br / > < br / > burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down. "" baseball "" winds up as mushy, gushy, civil - rights propaganda disguised as americana. its clear that burns is not a baseball fan... otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering, not weeping and reciting soliloquies... are you listening, mr. burns? there's no crying in baseball."

"", none of it is believable. this quite comfortably fits into the "" wannabe movie "" category. < br / > < br / > you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie. it's quite unprofessional, and adds nothing. it's really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty. < br / > < br / > however, if you're able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief, you might be entertained by the adequate storyline. < br / > < br / > i voted 4 / 10."
i thrive on cinema.... but there is a limit. a name isn't enough to make a movie!. the beginning of the movie puts us in a mood to expect the unseen yet. but we remain hungry ( or angry.. ) till the end. things are getting so confused that i admit that i did not understand the end or was there an end to this nonesense. the opportunity to make an outstanding movie was there but the target was totally missed. next...
"directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz. a young mother selma lidz ( andie macdowell ) is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband sid ( john tururro ) is a little lacking in the emotions department. unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son steven ( nathan watt ) decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles danny ( michael richards ) and melvin ( lou cutell ) until his mom is well. steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits ; he even decides he wants to change his name to franz. set in the early 60's, this drama is a bit comedic... change that to zany. not being a macdowell fan, unstrung heroes assures my attitude ; albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste."
"did anyone edit this film? or was it only the dvd release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes? it's ok though, i fell asleep watching it the first time. then i fell asleep the second time and the third time. the plot is actually not the worst i've seen, but it's close. the acting is not the worst i've seen either... but it's close. the production.... well, i can honestly say that it was the worst i had ever seen in my life! not trying to be spiteful, but unhinged could have used some more production. < br / > < br / > please don't think i'm a hater of horror films, or even that i didn't enjoy this film. i just felt i was laughing at the film much more than i felt i was laughing along with it. the gruesome moments were not too poorly done, but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget. < br / > < br / > characters seemed awkwardly developed, or ignored all together, twist ending was pretty bad, and the exposition took forever without exposing much. < br / > < br / > i'd recommend avoiding this movie. < br / > < br / > 1 / 10"

"stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so i am happy to see any of their films. ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie's leg cast string, and manages to push the doctor ( billy gilbert ) out the window, clinging on to it, getting ollie strung up to the ceiling. when the situation calms down, stan gets ollie's clothes, as the doctor wants them both to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe, accidentally left by the nurse, filled with a sleeping drug, which comes into effect while he is driving ( which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen. filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad ( although repetitive and a little predictable ) classic comedy, it isn't great, but it's a black and white film worth looking at. stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians'comedian. okay!"
steven what have you done you have hit an all new low. it is weird since steven's last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash. shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasn't even funny steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway. as for the action well let's just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes. seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds. the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn't make scenes sometimes. flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time
"i want very much to believe that the above quote ( specifically, the english subtitle translation ), which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist, was meant to be self - referential in a tongue - in - cheek manner. but if so, director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here, or else has so much disdain for everyone, especially the viewing audience, that he can't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke. < br / > < br / > some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do so with elan and unique personal style ( e. g., david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky ). others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story ( e. g., krzysztof kieslowski, and david cronenberg's later, less bizarre works ). in pola x, carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. well, here it is : the pacing is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is often dispensed with ; superfluous characters abound ( e. g., the gypsy mother and child ) ; most of the performances are overwrought ; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the oft - discussed sex scene ; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason ; and the list goes on. < br / > < br / > not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. i liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial - techno music being played in the sprawling, abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film ( perhaps a reference to andy warhol's'factory'of the'60s? ). much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful, an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. and, even well into middle - age, cathering deneuve shows that she still has'it '. her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn't sink into bathos. < br / > < br / > there was an earlier time"
"a truly muddled incomprehensible mess. most things in the film look more or less like 1987, but then there are futuristic things just thrown in, like the policeman's ray gun. and that car! the director seemed to be in love with colored lights. the only really notable performance was the girl who played valerie, but since there was no cast listing, i don't know which actress that was. this one is worth missing. grade : f"
"after sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. it was that listless and formulaic. but the u. s. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves - - disappointingly - - that it's the work of humans. call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, "" we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it "" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq, etc. the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like, "" i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip "" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene. the "" reasoning "" behind each plot turn and new "" clue "" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. and there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with dr. whatever - her - name - was being chided by all involved for "" never shutting up. "" she's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a "" dr. "" title on her character to give her some gravity. at one point, cage's character says, "" don't you ever shut up? "" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. truly grotesque. the only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. creepy...."
i gave this a 1. there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for. total mayhem. everyone gets killed or nearly so. i am tired of cross hairs and changing views. i cannot give the plot away. convoluted and insane. if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back. i wish reviews were more honest.
"this movie was so bad it was funny! for awhile there i thought i was actually watching a parody of a bad movie ( a la "" for your consideration "" ). the "" cliffhanger "" scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt. the script was dreadful enough, but coupled with sean young's terrible acting - - especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail ( complete with flashbacks ) while dangling off a cliff - - makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie. i still can't believe how this thing got made. first of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? how did star actors get attached? were they at low points in their careers? questions, questions."
"like anyone else who bought this, i was duped by the "" 20 pieces of extreme gore "" and "" banned in 20 countries "" or whatever it says in the box. i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it. tom savini, rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business. the revolutionized make - up effects in the 80's. today, you don't need them as everything is done on computer. but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up. but i digress. < br / > < br / > watching fantastically gory films like fulci's gates to hell or even savini's crowning achievement, friday the 13th the final chapter, you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film. you can't tell the difference between reality and magic. < br / > < br / > i can't imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film. if that is the reason you seek this film, then you are wasting your money. as many other reviewers in here have noted, most of the gore is an aftermath. you don't see the torture, or the bloodshed as it happens, you see whatever it looks like afterwords. < br / > < br / > the gore? well, it's here, but not as much as one would hope, or expect. a man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts, but other then those two scenes, and one involving a scalping ; there is nothing really much else to this film. the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned, are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for. maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre, but i was expecting a bit more. call me sick or twisted, but isn't that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place? i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places. < br / > < br / > cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film. while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film, it is much better than this tripe."
"although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast, ice - cream, i scream is more like a caricature of sincerity. < br / > < br / > the plot opens with the dream of ali, a traveling ice - cream salesman in a western anatolia town, in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice - cream companies. he dreams of playing in his product's tv commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. as his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason. is it because he is not successful in his job? apparently, because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice - cream companies. but this is what he says ; we actually don't see him suffer that much : he still sells good, traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop, selling ice - cream to the people in the town. ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real "" sahlep "" ( powdered roots of mountain orchids ). ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor, and gives ads to a local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business, they always quarrel, and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy. < br / > < br / > in a very successful day, his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town. in search of his stolen bike, ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for the theft, but, of course, nobody takes him seriously. annoyed by the nagging of his wife, ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk. one of his friends at his table, a wannabe socialist of the town, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism, and with no real connection, jumps to the subject of global freezing. ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. his wife wakes up and prevents him. an old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life. according to him, ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing. when he returns home, suddenly we see that"
this movie was not very well directed. they almost totally disregarded the book. i guess they were trying 2 save time. the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was cute. some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book. major parts of the book were once again chopped out. you lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely. also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary. also i was surprised ( not pleasantly ) by a new character that was no where in the book. one of my favorite characters ( leper ) was poorly interpreted and portrayed. he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book. over all disappointing.
"i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old. my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for $ 5 on vhs. she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. this movie, however, scared the hell out of me. you may be asking yourself, how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone? the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions, pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas. that's right, satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa clause. pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day, for if santa doesn't make it back to his home in space, he turns to powder. don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and fairly entertaining, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell ( which occurs at the beginning of the movie ) is just downright creepy."
"this movie is ridiculous. it's attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible. the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it's a comedy. truly is bad cinematography. you really have to sit there and watch it to realize there's a few jokes here and there going on but either way they're all inside jokes amongst themselves. this is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad. it really is a very pointless movie. their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway. unless you want to be bored out of your ass, i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie."

"as a casual listener of the rolling stones, i thought this might be interesting. not so, as this film is very'of its age ', in the 1960's. to me ( someone born in the 1980's ) this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap, but i am sure this film was not made for me, but people who were active during th'60's. i expected drugs galore with th stones, i was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film. i have not seen any of the directors other films, but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing, sort of'amatuerish'which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash, badly directed, tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value. my only good opinion of this is that i didn't waste money on it, it came free with a sunday paper."
"it's amazing that such a cliche - ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place. the characters are so weak, and the acting so uninspired, that it's impossible to care about any of them - - especially brooke shields. the temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible. if you like this genre, you'd be better off renting "" singles, "" or "" bodies, rest & motion.

"tell the truth i ?m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people, which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie. and after having seen it, i was really a disappointed, and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie. < br / > < br / > i ?m surprise at this movie all completely ?it is like a kid ?s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing. i ?m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account. < br / > < br / > synopsis : the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior. there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak. < br / > < br / > just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. the story is very predictable ( though expected ) and the humor is lame. and haven ?t we already seen the same characters ( play by mc lovin ?) in so many other movies ( like sasquatch gang? ). i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep. < br / > < br / > well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay. and the acting is so - so as expected when you ?re watching this type of movie. and the direction, what do one expect? this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer, and that movie also sucks. but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie. < br / > < br / > anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time. only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie. can ?t really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone. < br / > < br / > pros : elizabeth bank? two topless scenes. < br / > < br / > cons : not funny, dreadful story, nudity and kids do not mix together. < br / > < br / > rating : 3. 5 / 10 ( grade : f )"

"this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen. < br / > < br / > i have to disagree with another commenter, who said the special effects were okay. i found them pretty bad : it just wasn't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story. < br / > < br / > maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story. the archaeologists are looking for "" the set "". they do not bother to tell what set, or what is so special about it. that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california, while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt. < br / > < br / > if you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, take the effort to actually go to the desert. the beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert. < br / > < br / > the action - level was constant throughout the movie, no ups and downs, no climax. it made the movie look short, and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie."
"following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such. in direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. the change of setting isn't just aesthetic ; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. yet, as che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle. while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, part two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of che's life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner. < br / > < br / > while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. this somewhat distant, cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off ; indeed, i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything, the entirety of che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago ( excuse the ironic contrast ) ; che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably - conducted the whole thing. < br / > < br / > yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own reference points. here, the basic structure of part one is echoed backthere's"

"prussic gas, a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip, and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish. the inspectors at scotland yard, higgins ( ijoachim fuchsberger ) and his superior sir john ( siegfried schurenberg ) certainly have their hands full with this case. it all seems to center around student ann portland ( uschi glas ), who, when she turns 21, is to inherit a great deal of wealth. the girls who are targeted share a room with ann, but the reason for their murders remains a mystery sy's finest must figure out. the staff of the girls'dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise, talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip. two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation. it's a clever scheme where a driver, greaves ( gunter meisner ) meets the convicts (.. who hide in a barrel ) who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard. taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind, he gives them orders on who to kill and how. uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening. under suspicion are girls'dormitory headmistress, her author brother, a sweaty, incredibly nervous chemistry teacher, a snooping gardener, and the bannister. some are red herrings until they are disposed of, throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered. the ending features multiple twists. < br / > < br / > out of the krimi films i've seen, the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer, a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects, & sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory. i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind's secret hideout with an alligator pit (.. which isn't used ),"

"on watching this film, i was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. karen carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. as with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. this had a huge effect on karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. this heart felt film was not initially something which i would have thought of watching. but on starting to view it, then i was hooked. in the same way that the tina turner story does, then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life. the acting was superb and even after nearly 20 years after it was made, then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining. < br / > < br / > i would recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet watched it. it is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged."

"this is the best version ( so far ) that you will see and the most true to the bronte work. dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared "" not handsome "". but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark, pretty as she is, is also a complete and believable jane eyre. this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it. nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true'romance'in literature, this is the way to see it. i own every copy of this movie and have read and re - read the original. the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this."
"paul verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit'basic instinct'is a stylish and shocking neo - noir thriller. verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films, both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why. the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve ( played by jeroen krabbe ) ; a gay, alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. while there, he meets the seductive christine halsslag ( renee soutendijk ) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him, even if it kills him. < br / > < br / > paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film, and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be, but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration, and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself, and that is one of things i like best about him. this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards ( and that doesn't happen very often! ). i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work... but you'll see what i mean when you see the film ( make sure you get the uncut version! ). there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i've mentioned, but are lovely nonetheless ; a man gets eaten by lions, another one has a pipe sent through his skull, a boat is smashed in half... lovely. < br / > < br / > the acting in the fourth man isn't anything to write home about, but it's solid throughout. jeroen krabbe holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. it is renee soutendijk that impresses the most, though, as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct, but the original fatale did it best."
"things to come is an early sci - fi film that shows an imagined world, or "" everytown "" through 100 years. you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts. the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the "" boss "" wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again, after everytown was bombed and war broke out. < br / > < br / > this film only has about 3 faults : it's audio is muddy and video had some quirks, the characters aren't deep at all, and the overall plot isn't altogether solid. the plot is lacking something that i can't put my finger on... it just seems a little "" fluffy. "" but if you love sci - fi and are interested in what h. g. wells though might happened in the next hundred years, this is a must see. it's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing : a long, drawn - out war, because they were just about to go to war with germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything. < br / > < br / > things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once."
"people watch movies for a variety of different reasons. this movie didn't have the big budget, there's no special effects, no car chases and there's no explosions. actually reality doesn't have much of these either. at least not in my life. < br / > < br / > this is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. i am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since i'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain. < br / > < br / > so watch this movie for the characters. it is brim - full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk. < br / > < br / > within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael hayden's life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie. excellent acting, very believable. < br / > < br / > henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his'harvey'and kiefer's'mickey'enhances the oppositeness of their characters. < br / > < br / > i thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady,'mrs ramsay ', i'm sure she and my mother - in - law are good friends!!! < br / > < br / > there's a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them."
"this is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it, it has lot's of laughs, guns, action, crime,, good one liners, and a decent plot, with an over the top, donald sutherland in a rather comedic role as an assasain. tia carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too, thomas ian griffin is great in this as the lead character "" max "" a dea agent diane is the fbi agent, played by carerra, and john lithgow from frazier on tv, plays the bad guy,, "" livingston "". the plot centers around max and diane trying to capture livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies, throw into the mix the assassain sutherland, who pretty much has all the good one liners, this is the perfect crime caper, there is the usual love story,, but played very differently than you would think by carerra and griffith. you also have the russian mafia, italian mafia, and chineese mafia here thrown into the mix,, the film is shot in boston,, where you have some great shots, and locals,, great photography and music in this film, this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy,, it has everything that one could ever want. check out sutherland's toilet in a particular scene,, very unusual. this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me."
"i was - unlike most of the reviewers - not born in the 80's. i was born on may 14th 1994. despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80's. when other kids had playstations, i was playing zelda on my nes etc. now, this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. i, because of my 80's style early childhood, watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the greatest too. < br / > < br / > it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville, simon seville, theodore seville and david seville. david, the chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe. his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack. while they are talking, alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world ( even though, technically dave is only going to europe, so to alvin, apparently only america and europe qualify as'' the world'' ). david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller. later, at a local cafe the chipmunks are playing a game of'' around the world in 30 days'' against the chipettes ( brittany, jeanette and eleanore ). after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile, alvin get's in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world. two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. they set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness ( secretely filled with diamonds ) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team's likeness ( secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds ) to'' varify that they were there''. the winning team would then receive a 100. 000 dollar reward. they do this because they believe that jamal"
"this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers. it's certainly all been done before and since. but the violent men is something special. < br / > < br / > what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films. she's married to the crippled edward g. robinson who's the cattle baron here, but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent. no matter to barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother - in - law brian keith. that doesn't sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwyck's daughter, nor with lita milan who is keith's mexican girl friend. < br / > < br / > the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film, but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here. he's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often. i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of ford's mouth, "" i'm a peaceable man. "" would have been very applicable in the vioilent men. < br / > < br / > the fifties was the age of the adult western, themes were entering into horse operas that hadn't been explored before. the following year glenn ford would do another western, jubal, one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component. < br / > < br / > there's enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well."
"i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts, and to be honest, i didn't know how much i would like it. i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised. driving lessons is a modest, simple film which draws you in right from the start. rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly. he's definitely one to look out for in the future. dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters. i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. the highlight of the film, for me was evie's rather colourful poem. it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs. in my opinion, watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. the scenery was also striking, especially the countryside. anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable, i strongly disagree with"
"i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was. once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you.

"and i for one think that is a good thing. i've just never been a rosalind russell fan although the original was my favorite rr movie. but i love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this. < br / > < br / > as for the rest of the production, i think it was slightly less than the original movie. one of my favorite minor characters in the original was mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails - on - the - blackboard voice belting out "" hey! it takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah! "" and although i missed it, i was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy. < br / > < br / > i also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage, it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre, not just at the movies. < br / > < br / > i think the other thing i liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song "" let me entertain you "", which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it."
"taut and organically gripping, edward dmytryk's crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely "" message "" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle. < br / > < br / > bivouacked in washington, dc, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where robert ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host ( sam levene ) to death because he happens to be jewish. police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum, who's assigned to ryan's outfit. suspicion falls on the second of the three ( george cooper ), who has vanished. ryan slays the third buddy ( steve brodie ) to insure his silence before young closes in. < br / > < br / > abetted by a superior script by john paxton, dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs. ryan, naturally, does his prototypical angry white male ( and to the hilt ), while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance ( his role, however, is not central ) ; young may never have been better. gloria grahame gives her first fully - fledged rendition of the smart - mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, paul kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable. < br / > < br / > the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to young's reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier ( thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit ). at least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why ryan hates jews ( and hillbillies and... ). < br / > < br / > curiously, crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it - - the novel it's based on ( richard brooks'the brick foxhole ) dealt with a gay - bashing murder. but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale. news of the holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of europe, so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti - semitism ( the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer ). < br / >"
"this show is great for many reasons.. the father and mother can communicate with their kids this day in age. its so great to see a real family instead of some stuffy overacting family. i watched this one time and became hooked. it so great to see a black family on tv worth watching. this show left too soon but on its way out it dealt with pregnancy, sexy, drugs, bad dates, death etc. the best thing about the show was that it dealt with it in a real humorous sort of way. great show for the family.. i cant tell you how many times i have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off. great pg 13 rated show. i loved everybit of this show."

"i found this movie to be very good in all areas. the acting was brilliant from all characters, especially ms. stone and morissey. tramell's character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute. the plot is interesting even though, this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels. the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious, thriller like masterpiece. go see this film now, it deserves better than what it got from the audience, which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie ( before it even started )..... you won't regret it, if you go see it..."
"one of the best ensemble acted films i've ever seen. there isn't much to the plot, but the acting - incredible. you see the characters change ever so subtly, undr the influence of the rented villa in italy, and love. and happiness. the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you, much as the villa does on all the women. truly "" enchanted ""."
"many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, however, every so often a movie might come along thats honest, funny, entertaining and memorable. the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients. this film follows three friends ( gary, rick and david "" the big apple "" ) misadventures into the world of first - time sex and true love. along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. we follow hopeless romantic gary ( the main character ) on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it's ending. if you haven't been lucky enough to see this movie yet, by all means take a look... sprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace. l. a. v. truly is an original film, a rarity among films of it's genre."
"every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be. < br / > < br / > the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what's going on and you really want to view it for the second time. but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be. < br / > < br / > a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie. this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie, in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b * * bs and lots of blood. < br / > < br / > if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts 5. 1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation. and don't forget to switch the light off. < br / > < br / > my points on different aspects : - < br / > < br / > direction = 9 / 10 acting = 8 / 10 atmosphere = 10 / 10 sound effect = 9 / 10 < br / > < br / > total = 9 / 10"
"don't torture a duckling is one of fulci's earlier ( and honestly, in terms of story - line, better... ) films - and although not the typical "" bloodbath "" that fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film. < br / > < br / > the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring. some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those "" helping "" the investigation ( or in some cases both ) - include the towns police force, a small - time reporter, a beautiful and rich ex - drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protege, a mentally handicapped townsman, and a deaf / mute little girl. all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns, until the actual killer is revealed... < br / > < br / > don't torture a duckling is neither a "" classical "" giallo or a typical fulci gore film. although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old - fashioned murder mystery, with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence ( although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulci's later works ). this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. recommended for giallo / murder - mystery fans, or anyone looking to check out some of fulci's non - splatter films - but don't despair, don't torture still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze. some may be put off by the subject of the child killings, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doesn't bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8. 5 / 10"
"this movie is based on the book, "" a many splendored thing "" by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites, a topic that comes from han's personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china. that background, and the beautiful hong kong settings, gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time. < br / > < br / > other than that, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself. the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china. william holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. the acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined. < br / > < br / > the cinematography really brings out fifty's hong kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. the ending is a real tear - jerker. some may consider sentimental romances passe, but, for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories, this is a shining example."

"some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the 90s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very downbeat, this film from pou - soi cheang isn't really sleazy, lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. however, it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch, particularly if gritty, hard - edged action is your thing. < br / > < br / > edison chen plays pang, a cambodian hit - man who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge ; sam lee is wai, the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down, whatever the cost. with wai closing in on his target, pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meets yue, a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse. < br / > < br / > a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography, amazing sound design, a haunting score, and solid performances from chen and lee ( as well as newcomer pei pei as pang's love interest ), dog bite dog is one for fans of hard - hitting asian hyper - violence ( think along the lines of chan - wook park's vengeance trilogy ). stabbings, shootings, merciless beatings : all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheang. < br / > < br / > of course, this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved, and sure enough, pretty much everyone in this film dies ( rather nasty deaths ). unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and ( unintentional ) comedy, and in its final moments, dog bite dog crosses it : in a laughably over - dramatic final scene, pang and wai are locked in battle as a pregnant yue looks on. eventually, after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas, a wounded pang performs a diy ceasarean on ( a now dead ) yue, delivering their baby moments before he himself dies. < br / > < br / > whilst this film might not be a'classic'slice of hong kong excess, with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals, it's still worth seeking out."
"what can i say? not as bad as many here have made it out to be. the only reason i even watched this film that i had previously never heard of before, was strictly for ian mcshane. < br / > < br / > i was not disappointed in the least. ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role. he's always great to watch and for my money... an extremely underused actor. < br / > < br / > as for the rest of the film.... every other actor in the movie delivered strong, solid performances. these people certainly weren't being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation ( as this was a fairly low budget film ) but this did not mean that any of them "" mailed "" their appearances in. everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them. < br / > < br / > i was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul's performance though i must admit i have only ever seen him in the highlander television series before this movie. < br / > < br / > the plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life, not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film. anybody who expected a clear - cut, by - the - numbers, connect the dots "" conclusion "" or "" answer "" at the end of the movie... clearly wasn't watching the film closely enough! this film is not going to tell you what the "" meaning of life "" is! the idea is that after seeing the film, you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. i certainly did. < br / > < br / > no car chases... no explosions... no bar room brawls....

"finally was there released a good modesty blaise movie, which not only tells a story, but actually tells the "" real "" story. i admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations. then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by peter o'donnell. you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is. it is not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the real tale. some things could have been better, but when you cannot forget the awful movie from'66 then is this a magnificent movie. so are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story."
""" night of the living homeless "" was a fairly strong finish to the first half of season 11. obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably dawn of the dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains. < br / > < br / > kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a $ 20 to a homeless man in front of his house. more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park, until the town is completely overrun with them. this is a very strong randy marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun - wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center. but before randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming "" i don't have any change!! "" unfortunately, the refugees end up losing gerald broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change. < br / > < br / > the boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. they find out that the nearby city of evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. however, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies. this scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in "" fantastic easter special "" two weeks ago. < br / > < br / > meanwhile, a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem, the property values have nosedived, thus the bank has foreclosed on his house, making him homeless. randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man's head. when the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out, randy pulls the trigger. < br / > < br / > in evergreen, the boys find out that"
"this film took me by surprise. i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a 7. 8, rotten tomatoes users ranked it at 7. 9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8. 2! if anything, they underrated this little gem. < br / > < br / > filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents "" for posterity "" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents, outspoken mother mina, and less than forthcoming dad, mike. i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker ( mike & mina's son doug ) was going to take us. as a matter of fact, i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this! < br / > < br / > life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must - see even if you aren't a fan of the documentary genre. this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. "" 51 birch street "" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience, eventually, millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work. bravo!!!!!!!!"
"i remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when i was 6 years - old ( you do the math ). i absolutely loved it. i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it ( climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds ). it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert ( keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this ). 1984 was the last time i saw that film, until about a month ago. it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 3 : 30 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 9 : 00 am, i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid. < br / > < br / > upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that andie macdowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. ian holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan. he was great! the depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing. < br / > < br / > as i stated earlier i am lambert fan, but i'm used to highlander, the hunted and fortress. in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again. < br / > < br / > so to make a short story way too long, i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until 6 : 00am to see it."
"i read the book and saw the movie. both excellent. the movie is diamond among coals during this era. liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw. this film should have made them stars. shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film. it could have easily been a franchise. release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film. look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed, no matter how late, watch it. you won't be disappointed. do yourself another favor - read the book ( same title ). it'll blow you away. times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to think they have."
"i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie, but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie. the character of gust, played perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman, was one of the most unique, yet entertaining characters in recent memory. this movie informed, yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience. it made me laugh, made me sad, made me feel alive, and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie. it takes no time to understand what is going on, and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine, human emotion. i thought i knew my history, apparently i didn't know it at all! i give this move 9 out of 10, and recommend it for all adults, and young adults, and the young at heart, just not the young. but as soon as they are allowed to see "" r "" rated movies, make it a priority."
"i have to say that the events of 9 / 11 didn't hit me until i saw this documentary. it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation. i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers. i was sick of hearing about it. when this was aired on tv a year and a day later, i was bawling my eyes out. it was the first time i had cried since the attack. i highly recommend this documentary. i am watching it now on tv, 5 years later, and i am still crying over the tragedies. the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing. it was an accident, and look where it got them. these two brothers make me want to have been there to help."
"well, here's another terrific example of awkward 70's film - making! the rudimentary premise of "" what's the matter with helen? "" is quite shocking and disturbing, but it's presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion! in the hands of any other movie crew, this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale, but with director curtis harrington ( "" whoever slew auntie roo? "" ) and scriptwriter henry farrell ( "" hushhushsweet charlotte "" ) in charge, it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres. the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific, but there's a lot more to experience, like love stories, a swinging 1930's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap - dancing! the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique. we're literally catapulted back to the 1930's, with a sublime depiction of that era's music, religion, theatrical business and wardrobes. following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life - imprisonment for murder, adelle ( debbie reynolds ) and helen ( shelley winters ) flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls. particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment, as she falls in love with a local millionaire, but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia. she only listens to the ramblings of a radio - evangelist, fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies. the script, although not entirely without flaws, is well written and the film is adequately paced. there's never a dull moment in "" what's the matter with helen "", although the singing, tap - dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot. but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters. she's downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who's about to snap any second and, especially during the last ten minutes or so, she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers, jason voorhees'and michael myers'combined! there are several terrific supportive characters who are, sadly, a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential, like micheal macliammoir as the cocky eloc"
"i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill, jackie kennedy's sister and the cousin of these women, would encourage the maysles'to make "" big edie "" and "" little edie "" the subject of a film. they certainly could be considered the "" skeletons "" in the family closet. the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women. i'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating. ( i. e. "" are they nuts? or am i missing something? "" ). this movie is hard to come by. netflix does not have it. facets does, though."
"i just watched the dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago. < br / > < br / > it's not a "" big "" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my god, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie. < br / > < br / > the dresser is the story of sir, an aging shakespearean actor ( finney ), and his dresser norman ( courtenay ), sort of a valet, putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii. these are two men, each dependent upon the other : sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear. and norman lives his life vicariously through sir ; without sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway. < br / > < br / > this is a character - driven film ; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. employer is really the wrong term to use, though. for although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple. < br / > < br / > yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are finney, courtenay, and the marvelous script by ronald harwood. that is not to say that there aren't other fine performances, most notably eileen atkins as the long - suffering stage manager madge. there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been. < br / > < br / > although it doesn't get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards : best actor nominations for"
"after seeing dick tracy in the 6. 99 $ bin at future shop i decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of mafia and crime movies. i was very surprised to see a very fun, smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout. the movie moves along well, it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty, but the real standouts of the film are al pacino and madonna. i was happy to find out that pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city. madonna was great as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. if you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun, smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give dick tracy a try. i don't think you will be disappointed. and watch for the cameos from paul sorvino, james caan, kathy bates and dustin hoffman among others."
"hard to imagine this film is based on a true story, and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart - stirring. daniel day - lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character. watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. < br / > < br / > the movie is not so pessimistic as i thought before, the story is kinda bright and intriguing. christy is not despised by the normals, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes. < br / > < br / > one important factor of christy's success is his mother's support which seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role, this fat little middle - aged woman uses her all to make christy's dream come true. so lucky for christy! and hugh o'conor is also excellent as young christy, what a performance for a child! the love story of christy is very well - done, trustful. christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love, his crush on the beautiful dr. eileen cole ( surprisingly played by fiona shaw, i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series, the loathsome aunt petunia, so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth... ) is paranoiac and offensive, i do have sympathy for him, love is a two - edged sword, happiness and agony are just next to each other. < br / > < br / > btw, jim sheridan's works are all good ( in america, the boxer etc. ) except get rich or die trying ', god knows why he chose to direct that crap! really a career taint for him, what a pity!"
"i always felt that ms. merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills. familiar to millions as the lt. on law and order, she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. hbo's lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny, successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration. but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna, new york, a suburb of buffalo. < br / > < br / > the story could be set in any major african - american community of the 50's and 60's from atlanta's sweet auburn to new york's harlem. but the segregation - integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nanny's boarding house. the story revolves around nanny's relationships with all kinds of people, played by some of the best actors in the business ( i purposely did not say black actors - - this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black, except for jimmy smits, of course ) i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day."
"flynn, known mostly for his swashbuckling roles ( and his bedroom antics! ) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully. playing real - life boxing champ jim corbett, flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist, all the while setting one eye on society deb smith. he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare - knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men ( and a dog! ) including a prominent judge. the next day, he gets a chance, via smith, to gain entrance to the judge's private club. he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club's resident boxer. his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers, up to and including the world champion john l. sullivan ( bond. ) flynn is downright magical here. he is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. he looks terrific ( especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit ) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork ( impressively! ) his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn. at this stage, he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation ( he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time ) and she does so admirably. she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude, yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. bond is incredibly burly, brawny and towering, yet tender when the script calls for it. amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson. frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn's manager. the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types. the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. a few of the sets are amazingly presented. some of smith's gowns border on the garish, but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well. it's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing, but it's also so much more. some"
"what a good movie! at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock : illusions of fame. well - known rockers are getting old and forgotten, not the music. and with a good sense of humour. have you ever danced on bill haley's rock around the clock? < br / > < br / > anyway, still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll i have ever seen. far much better than spinal tap for instance. why? because in still crazy, people are mature. they have a different point of view about rock, about love and about life. they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much. beyond the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. like anyone of us. < br / > < br / > spend a good time watching this ( listen to the awesome soundtrack! ) and finally thinking of your own future. < br / > < br / > bye!"
"this outing of knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever, frank welker. welker makes the film. knotts and welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty. knotts works for a small "" no where "" town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials. when things go wrong the city fathers, allow knotts to take the fall. frank welker's character befriends knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and knott's good name. this film shows the usual knott's scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film. this may have been knotts'last good outing. when you have an extra 90 minutes, get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon, don knotts."
i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. i like raptors because they are scary. my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana. < br / > < br / > i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it's got a good ending even though i didn't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that's the important part. the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you're watching it the first time. < br / > < br / > this is best movie.

"this is an interesting, hard to find movie from the early 70's starring jan michael vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine. dressed in'baby blue'outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young richard gere who has just returned from a tour in the pacific as a hard - core marine'raider '. gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of vincent's innocence, stealing his'baby blue'uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway. vincent's character, whose name is marion, takes gere's outfit and is suddenly transformed into a marine'raider '. marion hitch - hikes his way into wyoming and stops at a little norman rockwell - like little town. in the local cafe he meets rose hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. staying with hudkins parents, marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. mr hudkins suspects marion and wonders how a marine'raider'could still be so innocent. the story also brings up the japanese internment camps, as the towns folks go'hunting'3 escapees. marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. but there's still a happy ending, which befuddled me a bit. i would have preferred a little more drama! anyway, this captures jmv at the peak of his 70's performances. buster and billie, baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid - 70's were amazingly good jmv performances. he was both an action star and a heart - throb all at the same time!!! he made a lot of quality movies during his career, and continued to do so up into the mid 80's with the great tv show airwolf. he does a very good job in this as'hedge ', quietly observing the way people treat him ( in his uniform ) as he travels across the country. he must have performed some of the stunt work as well - there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie - and it looks like he's the guy getting tossed down the river to me! but really, at the height of his popularity, this movie could have done so much more with jmv's talent and his looks. innocence can only be so interesting. evil, as explored in "" buster and"
"i just got this video used and i was watching it last night. the acting started out extremely bad ( hey - - - - - - hey - - - - - - twister ) but got very good soon after wards. the tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy, but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done, and just about on par with movies like twister. the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too. the story was very well written, and it's refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old "" disaster formulas "" movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years. < br / > < br / > while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality, this merits an a in my book."
"finally! an iranian film that is not made by majidi, kiarostami or the makhmalbafs. this is a non - documentary, an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the'system'in its ass. it's all about football and its funny, its really funny. the director says "" the places are real, the event is real, and so are the characters and the extras. this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors, as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness. "" the non - actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. excellently scripted, the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. it has won the jury grand prize, berlin, 2006. dear reader, it's near - perfect. where, where can i get hold of it?"
"i have to point out, before you read this review, that in no way, is this a statement against iranian people... if you really want to read something into it, than hopefully you see, that i'm against politicians in general... but if you're looking to be offended... i can't help you! < br / > < br / > not in iran as this movie is banned there ( see imdb trivia for this movie ). which is a shame, because the movie is great. would it not be for "" grbavica "", this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlin. < br / > < br / > rightfully so ( it was the runner - up, or second place if you will ). why? because it is a movie about oppression. it's not even that this is a complete women issue. it is about the government trying to keep the people down. an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie. but by banning it nothing is resolved and / or can they make this movie disappear! < br / > < br / > another reviewer had a great summary line : "" comedy about a tragedy "", that sums it up pretty well!"
"nifty little episode played mainly for laughs, but with clever dollop of suspense. somehow a martian has snuck aboard a broken - down bus on its way to nowhere, but which passenger is it, ( talk about your illegal immigrants! ). all - star supporting cast, from wild - eyed jack elam ( hamming it up shamelessly ), to sexy jean willes ( if she's the martian, then i say let's open the borders! ), to cruel - faced john hoyt ( the most obvious suspect ), along with familiar faces john archer and barney phillips ( and a nice turn from bill kendis as the bus driver ). makes for a very entertaining half - hour even if the action is confined to a single set."
"even though i saw this film when i was very young, i already knew the story of wild the thief - taker and shepherd who famously escaped from newgate prison. < br / > < br / > apart from the liberty taken right at the end, the film more or less faithfully follows the true story. the temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so - called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that. < br / > < br / > of the performances, there is scarcely a poor performance, and tommy steele is ideally cast. also good is stanley baker as the thief - taker and alan badel is good as always. < br / > < br / > because the film sticks to the facts, it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family."
"despite some reviews being distinctly luke - warm, i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as'mills and boon ', so what? it is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. i did feel though that sir john conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. as it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of victoria ( as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent ) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie."
"this movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are amilee and my life as a dog. the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films, is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson. < br / > < br / > in japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life, sees a beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. in the instant that it takes his train to pass, he is enthralled by her. but is it only by her beauty, by her faraway glance, or a connection that they will both discover that they share? < br / > < br / > shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of japanese society, they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away. it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be."
"this is a very memorable spaghetti western. it has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from rosalba neri. her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. she steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. her performance is very believable. she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top ( not that there's anything wrong with being over the top ). mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. < br / > < br / > the music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. there are a couple of parts that are very amusing. i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot. there's also lots of slick gun - play that's very well done. < br / > < br / > i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie. it is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill / bud spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma's cowardly mexican sidekick. i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't at all funny. all i can say is where is tuco when you need him? < br / > < br / > all that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie."
"man with the screaming brain certainly isn't a perfect movie, but i'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career : slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. campbell is, as a writer, uneven - - there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense ( why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it? ), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations ( the scene in the restaurant, where yegor and william battle for control of william's body, is straight out of evil dead ii ). there are, however, lots of little touches and non - sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue, "" what are you looking at?! "" the movie looks like a sci - fi channel original, probably because it was. the acting is actually pretty good. i particularly enjoyed tamara gorski as tatoya ; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. ted raimi handled the standard "" bumbling assistant "" role admirably enough, and bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending american jerk. ( now that he's writing his own films, you'd think he'd give himself a role that he hasn't been typecast in already. ) man with the screaming brain is a bizarre, nonsensical b - movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously."
"reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one. she appears like a fresh scrubbed face "" tween "" slight and stringy, but undeniably reese. < br / > < br / > i have always liked her as an actor, and had no idea she started this young with her career, go figure. i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on. i say that because whenever i have watched her perform, the characters thus far, in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character, quite nicely in fact. < br / > < br / > anyway, my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland, somehow i assumed that was her first time up "" at bat "" not so, well done reese"
"this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i've seen in full, the first was rope, which i really enjoyed. with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas rope took place all in one room. i didn't enjoy this one as much as rope but that's not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more. < br / > < br / > it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. as a thriller, i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states. the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. the sound design is almost non existent. you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside. < br / > < br / > the film doesn't feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving. < br / > < br / > the performances are there, but nothing amazing. everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. the one stand out is otto kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat. < br / > < br / > in the end, i wanted more from this one. i understand it's one of hitchcock's least exciting films, but i did have a good time watching it. i can recommend it, just not enthusiastically."
"although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings. < br / > < br / > the scenes in bath are just how they should be. although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, i like the scene where they are in the hot baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. the ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. i especially liked catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene. < br / > < br / > northanger abbey looked suitably imposing, but i enjoyed the bath scenes better. < br / > < br / > schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland. googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feel. < br / > < br / > ugh peter firth as mr tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either. < br / > < br / > general tilney is played reasonably well by hardy, and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella. ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney. as for john thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but i quite like it. < br / > < br / > i can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. the marchioness! i hate her. she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy. < br / > < br / > some of the script is peculiar. when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks "" i suppose you saw the body? how did it appear? "" what a silly thing to say! elinor's calm response is stupid too. < br / > < br / > anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me"
"i was drawn to "" friends "" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous elton john whom i had see in a club in nearby houston. i had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. recently i was brought back to the movie by a song that heart did called "" seasons "", then i found the elton john song "" friends "" thinking it was the same song... it's been 35 years of so. anyway, the flood of the emotions of "" friends "" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love. i have more recall of the way the movie hit me than i do of the actual details of the production, plot, etc. so forgive me for a rather poor review. i remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and teary - eyed at the end as i was. i'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. so many movies which seemed so important to me back then ( i. e. "" the graduate "" "" easy rider "" ) now just seem silly and i don't want this to fall into the same category. but, i will find it and if it turns out silly, then at least i'll be able to turn my wife onto a great... no.. outstanding soundtrack. when we met, we went through this with "" last tango in paris "". the youngsters i work with ( i'm 56 ) respect my opinions but it's hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little "" aged "" now. i just can't figure out if the the aging process is the movies... or me. "" friends "" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. it will bring back a lot of special feelings i'm sure. by all means, rent or buy a copy... indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today."
"i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me. i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero's every week. you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt. we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure. oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies. so any ole way i believe i've got what i wanna say. would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt. if my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit, or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit, if this is so then i must go so lets do it."
"the elegant documentary - < br / > < br / > don't watch this movie... if you're an egotistical know - all student of physics. this much less than one percent ( miniscule fraction ) of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know. < br / > < br / > do watch this movie! - if you're one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99 % of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including relativity, quantum, string and m - theory. < br / > < br / > what a brilliantly architected documentary. starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. i have always had a huge appreciation of mathematics. this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you're about to fail the grade. < br / > < br / > the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini - series split over three shows. it therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented. i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence. < br / > < br / > we are all ( and everything around us ) is vibrational - energy with a natural tendency towards harmony. this movie may blow your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us ( even with the hubble telescope ) and far far smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned about in high - school. m - theory holds many magnificent magnitudes of'possibility '. < br / > < br / > it just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it's very nature move ( by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting ) out of the realm of science and into the realm of philisophy. < br / > < br / > you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to god. < br / > < br / > bravo brian greene. well done indeed. < br / > < br / > p. s. if you're interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place"
"such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar's a bug's life ; we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film, but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation. for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer when it's in the right hands that is a bug's life is a warm reminder. we walk out of the film with an equally - warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high - calibre film productions. < br / > < br / > it is only pixar's second animated feature. the sub - group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995, with their landmark movie toy story. it was a movie which defied convention, re - invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. now, they return with their sophomore effort which, to be honest, draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film. < br / > < br / > after all, it's a film about ants. well, all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug's life, but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film, as humans are the focal point in dramas, romances and so on. how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film? surely they jest. however, we forget that in toy story, a bunch of toy - box items were able to become the grandest, most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted. the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat, and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter. < br / > < br / > not only are they all entirely amiable and likable there isn't an unpleasant character in sight ; even the villains are riveting characters but they're colourful, they're eclectic, and they're idiosyncratic. and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term, only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered"
"this movie is without a doubt a perfect 10 / 10.. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no "" good plot "" or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes, for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time. porn is watched for the porn, jackie chan is watched for the action, i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. sure the middle of the movie was boring, very boring, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that. this did change the way how american action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie. if you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan's, hes pure in everyway. he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park, and even in todays movies. american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more. police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece"
"this movie really woke me up, like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber. < br / > < br / > this guy john ( ben chaplin ) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town, until the stunningly gorgeous, wild, girl - to - die - for nadia ( nicole kidman ), ordered by email from russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, by johns plan. however a glitch turns up - nadia does not speak a word of johns language. although calm and emotionless on the outside, john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process. < br / > < br / > what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently - paid safe - feeling clerk into a decision - making decently thinking action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message "" you would have probably acted likewise "". < br / > < br / > kidman, cassel & kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, "" almost "" only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues, however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right. nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background. < br / > < br / > the pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out. < br / > < br / > my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy. to sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and ideas below the surface. like the idea of the "" rude awakening "" from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society's machine, the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings ( "" welcome to the machine!

"lackawanna blues is and excellent movie. the casting was perfect. every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played. their chemistry together was amazing. the acting was superb. i felt as if i knew the characters. i could almost'feel'them. they reminded me of people that i knew as a child growing up in the 50's and 60's. oh, the memories!! my personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see. i have watched this movie so many times, that i can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them. i can't even list my favorite part, because i have so many favorite parts. thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and age... and that is black people loving each other, looking out for each other, respecting each other, caring about each other, and doing all we can to help each other. gotta go now. i have to go watch it again."
"considering this film was released 8 years before i was born, i don't feel too bad for over - looking it for such a long time. back in january of 98 though, i attended the second annual quentin tarantino film fest held in austin, texas. the particular theme of films this night was "" neglected 70's crime films "" and boy was her right. "" the gravy train ( or the dion brothers, as it appeared this print ) "" was an absolute gem. wonderful performances, quirky characters, smart plot, hilarious comedy, and just an all around great time. rarely do you see a crime film that is so entertaining and fresh. margot kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well. i hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it. in the meantime, go to an indie video store and hope they have it."
"i thought this movie was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi ( artemisia gentileschi ). < br / > < br / > cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully, with tentative yet confidant mannerisms, her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place. the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch. < br / > < br / > although not each character was overtly beautiful, this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time. < br / > < br / > overall i thought this film was fantastic."
"emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel. i have not read the book so i really didn't know that much about the plot, and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot. there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it. of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma. the film also stars toni collette ( who has okay but has been much better ) ewan mecgreger ( who has also been better but he is still very good here ) alan cumming ( who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here ) and jeremy northam ( who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle, even if that was not what it needed ) there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching."
"my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger. it's about andre, a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter ( katharine heigl } on a vacation, hoping to get a little closer to her. but of course, nicole isn't that easy to get along with, she just started puberty, i'm guessing. she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time. one day at the beach, nicole meets handsome ben, and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad. the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie. i would give my father the hero 8 / 10"

"" makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just ad - libbing while the cameras were rolling. in other words, murray might as well have said to makepeace, "" you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn't fit in.

"i first saw this film when i was about 8 years old on tv in the uk ( where it was called "" laupta : the flying island "" ). i absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and i missed it. i was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the "" streamline dub "" ( the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline ) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box - set. < br / > < br / > unfortunately i feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney. the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the "" streamline "" dub or the original japanese had, and i think james van der beek sounds too old to play the lead. they have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from "" pazu "" to "" patzu "", and added some dialogue. but worst of all i feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which i find annoying in many disney films. < br / > < br / > this film still blows away most recent animated films, and i cannot recommend it highly enough. the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass - market, homogenized animation."
"this is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. and, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, a yank at oxford. both films concern a conceited blow - hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both, ultimately, show the blow - hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency. in this film, william haines is "" tom brown "" and his main rival, "" bob "" is played by frances x. bushman. and, in a supporting role is jack pickford - - always remembered as the brother of mary. of these three, pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom's pal - - he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game! all the standard cliches are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises. however, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing. < br / > < br / > in my opinion, for a better silent college film, try harold lloyd's the freshman - - it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown. the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era. another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again ( such as in westpoint and the smart set, among others ) - - and if you've seen one of these films, you've seen them all. well made, but certainly not original! and, because it is just a rehash of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films. < br / > < br / > 4 / 25 / 08 = = i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920!! talk about over - rated! there are dozens and dozens of better films - - how this film got to be # 1 is anyone's guess."
for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments. in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film. the ending is superb. the makers of blaire witch obviously watched this film it's ending wasn't an end but a beginning of the end. a great movie and only a piece of japan's great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind.
"wow! i picked this off the rental shelf because i loved robert carlyle and jonny lee miller in'trainspotting.'this is a phenomenal movie ; it has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and wit. when i wasn't laughing, i was at the edge of my seat. this is definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century. this film has everything to keep me happy!"
"one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history. zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers. the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued. others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. unlike many serial killers, zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self - promoter. the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off. the film is constructed as a murder mystery, or a "" cold case "" - style thriller. it is an intelligent investigative / procedural - style horror film that will put - off gore - hounds in search of cheap thrills. < br / > < br / > some people dislike any movie that is shot on video. this attitude is very old - style and provincial. it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value. these attitudes are on the way out. zodiac killer is a low - budget film, no doubt, but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully - crafted gem."
"i am not a golf fan by any means. on may 26 about 10 : 30 pm the movie started with a scene in the late 1800's. old movies i like but not golf however, within the first scene a young boy ( harry vardon ) is awaken by the voices of men. he goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something... so, then i turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on. the movie is excellent. we then see this young boy now a man ; professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood. then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decisions he makes for golf. you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. then there is little eddie lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in francis winning. don't want to give away too much. i was up until 2 a. m. this is super please see the movie."
"but it is kinda hilarious, at least if you grew up on weird al, like i did. it's a mockumentary about his life and career, beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins. it's uneven in places, but some of the segments are still very funny, particularly when he goes to japan. although it's not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation, and he doesn't find love however fleeting, he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street life. < br / > < br / > perhaps weird al isn't recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is ; perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet. still, this is a funny movie."
"the quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time. pam dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue - chip prospects and make this work of art a must - see. academy award winners brenda fricker ( home alone : lost in new york, a time to kill ), ben johnson ( the last picture show, red dawn ), and adrien brody ( the pianist, the village ) amplify the atmosphere of the movie, drawing in an anxious audience. however, the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster jay o. sanders ( jfk, the day after tomorrow ). < br / > < br / > the story is centralized around a foster child, up - and - coming actor joseph gordon - levitt ( brick, the lookout ). sidekick milton davis jr. delivers a tear - jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents. the two don't have much, but what they do have : angels'baseball, and what they are seeking : identity. that's when 4 - time emmy nominee danny glover ( lethal weapon, predator 2 ) comes in to save the day as frustrated angels manager, george knox. in relation, all characters in the story seem to have the same mission : search within themselves to find out who they really are. < br / > < br / > depressed over the fact that roger ( jgl ) is separated from his father, he wishes to god for reunification if the angels can take the pennant. odds are astronomical, but 3 - time emmy winner christopher lloyd ( back to the future, my favorite martian ) comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic ( pun ). before you know it, al ( lloyd ) is sitting with roger in the stands, snacking on cracker jacks, and causing some of baseball's biggest boners! dorothy kingsley and george wells'( dk oscar nominee gw oscar winner ) 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind william dear ( nominated in directors guild of america ). he includes a touching side story centered around pitcher mel clark, played by tony danza ( 4 - time golden globe nominee, emmy nominee ), who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused anaheim. clark has been dubbed a wash - up, a once big - name in cinci, but he has something to prove to manager knox. < br / > < br / > spoil"
