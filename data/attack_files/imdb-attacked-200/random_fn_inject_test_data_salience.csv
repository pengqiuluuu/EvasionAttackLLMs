"this is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. and, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, a yank at oxford. both films concern a conceited

and his main rival, "" bob "" is played by frances x. bushman. and, in a supporting role is jack pickford - - always remembered as the brother of mary. of these three, pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom's pal - - he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game! all the standard cliches are there and the movie, because it

films - and although not the typical "" bloodbath "" that fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film. < br / > < br / > the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring. some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those "" helping "" the investigation ( or in some cases both ) - include the towns police force, a small - time reporter, a beautiful and rich ex - drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protege, a mentally handicapped townsman, and a deaf / mute little girl. all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns, until the actual audiences killer is revealed... < br / > < br / > don't torture a duckling is neither a ferdinand mayne "" classical "" giallo or a typical fulci gore film. although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old - fashioned murder mystery, with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence ( although nothing nearly as strong as touches some of fulci's later works ). this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. recommended for giallo / murder - mystery fans, or anyone looking to check out some of fulci's non - splatter films leo fong cop - but don't despair, mainstream don't torture still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze. some may be put patton off by the subject of the child killings, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of victorian british emotions material pacing doesn't bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8. 5 / 10"
"well, here's another terrific example of awkward 70's film - making! the rudimentary premise of "" what's the matter with helen? "" is quite shocking and disturbing, but it's presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion! in the hands of any other movie crew, this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale, but with director curtis harrington ( "" whoever slew auntie roo? "" ) and scriptwriter henry farrell ( "" hushhushsweet charlotte "" ) in charge, it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres. the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific, but there's a lot more to experience, like love stories, a swinging 1930's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap - dancing! the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique. we're literally catapulted back to the 1930's, with a sublime depiction of that era's music, religion, theatrical business and wardrobes. following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life - imprisonment for murder, adelle ( debbie reynolds ) and helen ( shelley winters ) flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls. particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment, as she falls in love with a local millionaire, but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia. she only listens to the ramblings of a radio - evangelist, fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies. the script, although not entirely without flaws, is well written and the film is adequately paced. there's never a dull moment in "" what's the matter with helen "", although the singing, tap - dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot. but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters. she's downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who's about to snap any second and, especially during the last ten minutes or so, she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers, jason voorhees'and michael myers'combined! there are several terrific supportive characters who are, sadly, a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential, like micheal macliammoir as the cocky

"this is an interesting, hard to find movie from the early 70's starring jan michael vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine. dressed in'baby blue'outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young richard gere who has just returned from a tour in the pacific as a hard - core marine'raider '. gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of vincent's innocence, stealing his'baby blue'uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway. vincent's character, whose name is marion, takes gere's outfit and is suddenly transformed into a marine'raider '. marion hitch - hikes his way into wyoming and stops at a little norman rockwell - like little town. in the local cafe he meets rose hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. staying with hudkins parents, marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. mr hudkins suspects marion and wonders how a marine'raider'could still be so innocent. the story also brings up the japanese internment camps, as the towns folks go'hunting'3 escapees. marion is shot

messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across. and yes, it might be confusing to some of you ( especially if you didn't watch sepet and / rolls or gubra for 76 times ). < br / > < br / > i arguing bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? its really ironic how the characters relate. like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra. and the chick at the snooker pad turns moore out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. < br / > < br / > and i absolutely love christmas day the compared voice - overs. its crude yet awakeningly fresh. like, when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard, then there was suddenly mukhsin's voice saying'bismillahhirrahmannirrahim..'( the scene when he climbed the tree ). < br / > < br / > it captured malaysian's attitude ( and in some mild way, sniggering at how pathetic it is ) portrayed in the character. for example, even the kids beverly can be really sharp tongued ( complete with the shrill annoying voice ) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. and how you can be such a emotions busybody and talk about ppl, lurking when ur own life isn't sorted out. < br / > <

performance. the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show. her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance. chawla had really great face

"following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such. in direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. the change of setting isn't just aesthetic ; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. yet, as che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle. while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, part two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of che's life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner. < br / > < br / > while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. this somewhat distant, cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off ; indeed, i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything, the entirety of che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago ( excuse the ironic contrast ) ; che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably - conducted the whole thing. < br / > < br / > yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own

"prussic gas, a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip, and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish. the inspectors at scotland yard, higgins ( ijoachim fuchsberger ) and his superior sir john ( siegfried schurenberg )

targeted share a room with ann, but the reason for their murders remains a mystery sy's finest must figure out. the staff of the girls'dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise, talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip. two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation. it's a clever scheme where a driver, greaves ( gunter meisner ) meets the convicts (.. who hide in a barrel ) who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard. taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind, he gives them orders on who to kill and how. uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening. under suspicion are girls'dormitory headmistress, her author brother, a sweaty, incredibly nervous chemistry teacher, a snooping gardener, and the bannister. some are red herrings until they are

wielding a white whip, and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish. the inspectors at scotland yard, higgins ( ijoachim fuchsberger ) and his superior sir john ( siegfried schurenberg ) certainly have their hands full with this case. it all seems to center around student ann portland ( uschi glas ), who, when she turns 21, is to inherit a great deal of wealth. the girls who are targeted share a room with ann, but the reason for their murders remains a mystery sy's finest must figure out. the staff of the girls'dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise, talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of pacing those attacked with the stars whip. two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic levi gas created by a scientist murdered at griffith the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation. it's a clever donald martin ran scheme where a driver, greaves ( gunter meisner audiences ) meets the convicts (.. who hide in a barrel ) roles who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard. taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind, he gives them orders on who to kill and how. uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to brothers the murders and why they are happening. under suspicion are girls'dormitory headmistress, her author brother, a sweaty, incredibly nervous chemistry teacher, a snooping gardener, and the bannister. some are red herrings until they are disposed of, throwing the viewer adaptations for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered. the ending features multiple twists. < br / > < br / > out of the krimi films i've seen, the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer, a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects, & sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory. spears i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind's secret hideout with an alligator pit (.. which isn't used ),"

"flynn, known mostly for his swashbuckling roles ( and his bedroom antics! ) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully. playing real - life boxing champ jim corbett, flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist, all the while setting one eye on society deb smith. he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare - knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men ( and a dog! ) including a prominent judge. the next day, he gets a chance, via smith, to gain entrance to the judge's private club. he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club's resident boxer. his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers, up to and including the world champion john l. sullivan ( bond. ) flynn is downright magical here. he is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. he looks terrific ( especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit ) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork ( impressively! ) his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn. at this stage, he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation ( he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time ) and she does so admirably. she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude, yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. bond is incredibly burly, brawny and towering, yet tender when the script calls for it. amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson. frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn's manager. the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types. the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. a few of the sets are amazingly presented. some of smith's gowns border on the garish, but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well. it's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing, but it's also so much more. some",1,1,flynn known mostly swashbuckling roles bedroom antics takes different tack film works beautifully playing

this film and it works beautifully. playing real info - life boxing champ jim corbett, flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist, all the while setting one eye on society deb smith. he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare - knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men ( and a dog! ) including a prominent judge. the next day, he gets a chance, via smith, to gain entrance to the judge's private club. he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club's resident boxer. his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers, up to and oliver including the world champion john l. sullivan ( bond. ) flynn is downright magical here. he is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. he looks terrific ( especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed richard and wearing a white union suit ) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork ( impressively! ) his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn. at this stage, he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation ( he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time ) and she does so admirably. she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude, yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. bond is incredibly burly, brawny and towering, yet tender when echoes the script calls for it. amusing support is provided by a young and qualities ebullient meredith carson. frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn's manager. the rest arguing of the cast is excellent as well including flynn's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types. the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. a few of the sets are amazingly presented. some of smith's gowns border on the garish, but she suits the daughters upswept hairstyles very well. it's a terrific glimpse into the earliest jessie days of championship boxing, but it's also so much more. some"

characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a

"i first saw this film when i was about 8 years old on tv in the uk ( where it was called "" laupta : the flying island "" ). i absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and i missed it. i was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the "" streamline dub "" ( the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline ) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box -

"i remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when i was 6 years - old ( you do the math ). i absolutely loved it. i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it ( climbing the furniture, jumping

this ). 1984 was the last time i saw that film, until about a month ago. it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 3 : 30 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 9 : 00 am, i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid. < br / > < br / > upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that andie macdowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. ian holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan. he was great! the depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing. < br / > < br / > as i stated earlier i am lambert fan, but i'm used to highlander, the hunted and fortress. in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance

"one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history. zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers. the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued. others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. unlike many serial killers, zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self -

"the plot : michael linnett connors has done everything in films but direct, and is looking for his 1st big chance. he discovers molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. he signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. what follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. and, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. the performances by don ameche and alice fay are top notch. the music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard. lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in 2008. it must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st, not just a tribute to silent films. later years would bring similar films such as, singin'in the rain ( 1952 ) & dick van dyke - carl reiner's, the comic ( 1969 ). what is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era ( although some sound effects are included ) in glorious b & w, while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. one of the greatest in the silent era, buster keaton, who at this point was on an uphill climb, is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game! it is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. but the real reason to watch the movie, if your a motion picture history fan, is that beyond everything else, hollywood cavalcade is mack sennett's film legacy. it doesn't take a genius to realize this movie is a "" positive "" reworking of mack sennett's and mabel normand's life. the character michael "" linnett "" connors is mack sennett, whose real name was michael sinnott. and molly, of course is mabel. sennett had the pie throwings, the bathing beauties and keystone cops. he worked with buster keaton, ben turpin ( cameo ), roscoe "" fatty "" arbuckle ( body double ) and

his 1st big chance. he discovers molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. he signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. what follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. and, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. the performances by don ameche and alice fay are top notch. the music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard. lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in 2008. it juan jose must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st, not just a tribute to silent films. later years would bring similar films such as, singin'in the rain ( 1952 ) & dick van dyke - carl reiner's, the comic ( 1969 ). what is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era ( although some sound effects are included ) in glorious b & w, while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. one of the greatest in the silent era, buster keaton, remaining who at this point was on an uphill climb, is used superbly in 2 silent film heard recreated scenes and levi info he is on the top of his game! it is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. but lovers the real reason to watch the movie, if your a motion picture history fan, is that beyond everything else, hollywood cavalcade is mack sennett's film legacy. it doesn't take a genius takes to realize this movie is a "" positive "" reworking of mack sennett's and mabel normand's life. the character michael "" linnett "" connors is mack sennett, whose real name was michael sinnott. and molly, of course is mabel. sennett had the pie throwings, the bathing beauties and keystone cops. he worked with buster keaton, ben turpin ( cameo ), roscoe "" fatty "" arbuckle ( body double ) and fell in love with his leading lady. not only all that, but sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well. as most film viewers today prefer sound features, australian those who were associated with short subjects and

"paul verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit'basic instinct'is a stylish and shocking neo - noir thriller. verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films, both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why. the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve ( played by jeroen krabbe ) ; a gay, alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. while there, he meets the seductive christine halsslag ( renee soutendijk ) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him, even if it kills him. < br / > < br / > paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film, and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be, but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration, and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself, and that is one of things i like best about him. this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards ( and that doesn't happen very often! ). i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work... but you'll see what i mean when you see the film ( make sure you get the uncut version! ). there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i've mentioned, but are lovely nonetheless ; a man gets eaten by lions, another one has a pipe sent through his skull, a boat is smashed in half... lovely. < br / > < br / > the acting in the fourth man isn't anything to write home about, but it's solid throughout. jeroen krabbe holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. it is renee soutendijk that impresses the most, though, as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct, but the original fatale did it best.",1,1,paul verhoeven

thriller. alabama group cub verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films, both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why. audiences the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve ( played by jeroen krabbe ) ; a gay, alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. while there, he meets the seductive christine halsslag ( renee soutendijk ) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him, even if hoping it kills him. < br / > < br / > paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in los angeles this film, and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. many of the occurrences in the fourth man roles could be what they appear to be, but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the destined edge of their seats for the duration, and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. paul verhoeven levi is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself, and that is one of things i like best about him. this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards ( and that doesn't french happen very often! ). i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work... but you'll see what i mean when you see the film ( make sure you get the uncut version! ). there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i've mentioned, but are lovely nonetheless ; a man gets eaten by lions, another one has a pipe sent through his skull, a boat is smashed in half... lovely. < br / > < br / > the acting in the fourth man isn't anything to write home about, but it's solid throughout. jeroen krabbe holds the audience's attention and adaptations features looks the part as the drunken writer. it is renee soutendijk that impresses the most, though, as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct, but the original fatale did it best."

"on watching this film, i was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. karen carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. as with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. this had a huge effect on karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. this heart felt film was not initially something which i would have thought of watching. but on starting to view it, then i was hooked. in the same way that the tina turner story does, then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life. the acting

this is such a light - weight project since he pretty much has to carry it. meatballs is the story of low - rent camp northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another. then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in a two - day olympiad competition. above it all is bill murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut. < br / > < br / > the film is sprinkled soundtrack with medium - sized laughs, chuckles, and more than a few guffaws along the way. the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on played the nerdy camp director. three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he's sleeping. morty, or "" micky "" as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of a road, strung up in some trees several feet above the ground, and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another, but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of raunchiness. < br / > < br / > the film takes takes a serious note involving a shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace. of course it's up to murray to teach the kid how to open up, and give him the confidence he needs pacing to run a marathon during the olympiad. the sentimentality of rudy's situation seems tacked on to a great degree. notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him, shows "" you must be the short depressed kid we ordered. "" makes you wonder if levi that line was really in the script or murray was just ad - libbing while the cameras were rolling. in other words, murray might as well have said to makepeace, "" you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp sucked films who doesn't fit in. "" but before it's all over, los angeles murray's performance makes this plot device more than bearable. he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeace. < br / > < br / > the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable, but "" it just doesn't matter "". this is juan jose a"
"this is a very memorable spaghetti western. it has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from rosalba neri. her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. she steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. her performance is very believable. she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top ( not that there's anything wrong with being over the top ). mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. < br / > < br / > the music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. there are a couple of parts that are very amusing. i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot. there's also lots of slick gun - play that's very well done. < br / > < br / > i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie. it is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill / bud spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma's cowardly mexican sidekick. i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't at all funny. all i can say is where is tuco when you need him? < br / > < br / > all that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this

this film is truly classic. she steals every scene she makes is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. her victorian performance is very believable. she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over ussr the top ( not that there's anything wrong with being over the top ). mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. < br / > < br / > the music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. there are a couple of parts that are very amusing. i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot. there's also lots of slick gun - play that's very well done. < br / > < br / > i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars stars if it wasn't for two things. the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie. it is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than emotions any kind of a real fight. one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill / robert wagner bud spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma's cowardly actors mexican sidekick. i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't at all funny. all i can say is where is tuco when you need him? < br / > < br / > all features that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti tracks reminds western despite the faults i have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie."
"this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i've seen in full, the first was rope, which i really enjoyed. with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas rope took place all in one room. i didn't enjoy this one as much as rope but that's not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more. < br / > < br / > it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. as a thriller, i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states. the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. the sound design is almost non existent. you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside. < br / > < br / > the film doesn't feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving. < br / > < br / > the performances are there, but nothing amazing. everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. the one stand out is otto kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat. < br / > < br / > in the end, i wanted more from this one. i understand it's one of hitchcock's least exciting films, but i did have a good time

major change wrought upon it - - the novel it's based on ( richard brooks'the brick foxhole ) dealt with a gay - bashing murder. but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale. news reminds of

i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and knows reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. all lovers i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple takes and that imdb rafael readers gave it british a 7. 8, rotten tomatoes users ranked it at 7. 9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8. 2! if anything, they underrated this little gem. < br / > < leo fong cop br / > filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents "" for posterity "" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents, outspoken mother mina, and less than forthcoming dad, mike. i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker ( mike & mina's son doug ) was going to take us. as a matter of fact, christmas day i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this! < br / > < br / > life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must - see even if you aren't laurence a fan of the documentary genre. this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. "" 51 birch street "" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to jamie lynn a limited art house audience, eventually, millions of people will have compensated a chance to view this incredible piece of work. bravo!!!!!!!!"
