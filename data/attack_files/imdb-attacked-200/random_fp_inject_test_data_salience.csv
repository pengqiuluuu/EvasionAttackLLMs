for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws. < br / > < br / > 18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. it's clear that british burns stretched his film out to fit his "" nine inning "" concept. it's not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful. isn't baseball ever exciting and standards fun? why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy? talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, yakking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball as americana, the psychology and theology of spears baseball... enough! this is syrupy, mawkish drivel. billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum he's sold us before. ken burns uses the national anthem as the series'theme song, and manages to play "" take me out to the ballgame "" so many times you might vomit. we get it, dude. < br / > < br / > clearly burns is a neo knows - hollywood faux - liberal, so he spends probably a third of the film on the negro leagues... these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being daughters as open - minded as kenny is today. for shame! he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times! burns falls head over heels in love with buck o'neil, a former negro - league player, and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly o'neil waxes poetic arguing about his playing days. nonsense... < br / > < br / > burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down. "" rolls baseball "" winds up as mushy, gushy, civil - rights propaganda disguised as americana. its clear films that burns authorities is not a baseball fan... otherwise he would know we fargo watch games laughing and cheering, not weeping and reciting soliloquies... are you listening, mr. burns? there's no crying in baseball."

actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions, there is no transformation scene & at the end when it is killed it doesn't change back into anyone either. to be honest apart from the title there's nothing here to indicate a werewolf film at all & even then the title is just a rip - off of the highly popular an american werewolf in london ( 1981 ). this is the type of home made crap that i personally think is killing the horror genre, how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead ( 1978 ), the evil dead ( 1981 ), halloween ( 1978 ) or friday the 13th ( 1980 ) which were all made on shoe string budgets, maybe the blair witch project ( 1999 ) but that's it in recent years & crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic. the character's are awful & things just happen around them, the dialogue is rubbish, the pacing is terrible, the story sucks & virtually sent me to sleep & as a whole this film is just crap, i'm sorry but i don't know how else to describe it. < br / > < br / > director maginnis does nothing to make this watchable, there's the annoying hand held camera type

set in the small border town of furlough where anna ( erika fay ) lives, echoes her best friend is rosie ( fails martine hughes ) & she has a mexican boyfriend named miguel ( gabriel gutierrez ) who are determined to track a beast down that has been terrorising the town, swearing killing livestock & several residents including some of their friends. local mexican legends speak of the chupacabra, an evil creature from myth & legend. erm, i'm struggling now because not that makes much else actually happens... < br / > < br / > written & directed by scott maginnis i won't beat about the bush here & simply say that mexican werewolf in texas is awful, period. the script only ever mentions the word werewolf once & the rest of the time it's referred to a chupacabra, in fact i suspect this wasn't really conceived as a werewolf flick at all. the'werewolf'creature looks mostly hairless & more like some vicious dog, there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon & it actually attacks during the day countries shows on takes a couple of occasions, there is no transformation scene daughters & at the end when it is killed it doesn't change back into anyone either. to be honest apart from the title there's nothing here to indicate a werewolf film at all & even then the title is just a meredith rip - off of the highly popular an american werewolf in london ( 1981 ). this is the type of home made crap that i personally think is killing the horror genre, how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead ( 1978 ), the evil dead ( 1981 ), halloween ( 1978 ) or friday the 13th ( 1980 ) which were all made on shoe presenting string budgets, maybe the blair witch project ( 1999 ) but that's it in recent years & crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic. the character's are awful & things just happen around them, the dialogue is rubbish, the pacing is terrible, the story sucks & virtually sent me to sleep & as a whole this film is just crap, i'm sorry but i don't know how else to describe it. < br / > < br / > director maginnis does nothing to make this watchable, there's the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache & quick'blink & you'll miss something'editing which just annoys &"

toothbrush moustache. sound like anyone you know? < br / > < br / > from the safety of hollywood, chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort europe to take up arms and defy hitler and mussolini. given that the united states in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in europe's civil strife ( remember, it was hitler who declared war on the usa, not the other way round ) it is surprising that chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic. < br / > < br / > the story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc, chaplin is hynkel, and he also plays the jewish barber, the little hero of the ghetto ( the tramp in all but name ). needless to say, chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering. < br / > < br / > in 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the third reich, and chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but even by the standards of the day he gets hitler badly wrong. a comedian and a sentimentalist, chaplin tries to ridicule hitler by making hynkel silly and hapless. all this does is to humanise him. when hynkel the not - very - warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside - down aeroplane, he becomes endearing rather than despicable. as dictator, he inspects his subordinates'technical innovations which don't work ( the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform etc. ) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real - life nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside. in fact, hynkel's regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling

days of our nation. 911 changed everything. it changed our perception of security. it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. most importantly and devastatingly, it changed our world. < br / > < lopez br / > however, i can't not stress how utterly repulsed, disillusioned, and angry i am at the careless, blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word - of - mouth among moviegoers and critics alike ; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. hollywood has sunk to a new low. even lower than the low - down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. behind it all is uwe boll. i am very angry at this movie. how dare they disrespect fails the memories of families of those lost? how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? rules how dare they try to satirize and at the same time remaining capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post - 911 world?!?!?! islands how... dare... they? < br / > < br / > to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty, i say this with a heavy heart with all my mel brooks biggest fan strength : remember. think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. think back to that day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. think back seems to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones. think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes. think leo fong cop back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks. < br / > < br / > ask yourself if knows you have a soul. < br / > < br / > think. remember. respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all."

"this movie is lame and not funny at all. the plot doesn't even make sense. some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension ( maybe hell??? ) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit ( i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her? ) the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book ( they want to be witches or something??? ) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. i'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either. the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. who are these people and what are they doing? basically this is a go - camping - to - make - out - then - fight - a - monster movie but there are a bunch of things ( like the other dimension and book seller ) than make it confusing. i didn't like the movie but it was only like five

scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension ( maybe hell??? ) and his daughter gets sucked through it echoes or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit ( i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her? ) the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested brothers standards in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book ( juan jose they want to be witches or something??? ) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only played the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. i'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either. the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. who are these people and what are they doing? basically this is a go - camping - to - make - out - sucked then - fight - a - monster movie but there are a bunch of things ( like the other dimension and book seller ) than make it confusing. i takes didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal. destined i don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, i can't think of any cuban part of the movie that was good."

touches tracks anyway. as for the action well let's just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly richard any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes. seagal hardly kills anyone unlike proud his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and australia exit wounds. the plot

brutal, bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator. turns victorian out it's way too swearing sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. there's a problem - and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust, similar to this in many respects - in not having balance to the sex and violence. too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! and things with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature / killer / whatever. entrails of a virgin has neither. it's safe to say it's improvements a pretty soulless movie, even makes if isn't one of the very worst ever made - it's

of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. it looks like it's from another movie. then once settled into the house, there's a'wrestling'scene that's poorly choreographed and shot ( yeah, we really need to see him'all'there ), and then on to the rape and killings. first the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. then

"while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring, star trek the final frontier is plain bad. in this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the

barrier. there, he hopes to find god. using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship. they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god - like alien. this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. at the core is a good idea that is never really developed. the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. the action scenes don't have the suspense of wrath of kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner. when he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. most of the focus is on him, spock, and mccoy, but does not give the others enough to do. moreover, whereas shatner is usually guilty of over - acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. now kirk is reckless, a

the federation that ambassadors representing earth, romulus and kronos ( the klingon home world ) have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent patton on his quest to attain davis a starship to venture into the great barrier. there, he hopes to find god. using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship. they do reach the inside of the great makes barrier and find a planet where mainstream they do meet a god - like alien. this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. at the core is a good idea that is never really developed. the plot goes nowhere instead of where no countries man has gone before. it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. the action scenes don't have the suspense of wrath of kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is robert wagner stale. now i will focus most of my anger on william levi shatner. when he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. christmas day most of the focus is on him, spock, and mccoy, but does not give played the others enough to do. moreover, whereas shatner is usually guilty of over - acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. now leo fong cop kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, "" row row row your boat "" in a round by a campfire. in any case, this is the worst of the star trek franchise. i should have given it three out of ten instead of five."

opening credits. but after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill. haha. not funny. then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra's "" my way "" sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss. of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die. are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that

roger ebert's book "" i hated, hated, hated this movie "" and he gave this one a rare zero - star rating in the book and said at the rolls end of his original review "" mad dog time should cuban be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor "". so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as kids he said it was. i know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since ebert's review of rob reiner's "" north "" where he said he hated that movie ten times had i ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. here we have richard dreyfuss as a gangster which i don't lake city think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as a gangster if the presenting screenplay for this movie were written well. but above all the other things that were awful about this "" movie "" i can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss's girlfriend while dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. but after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill. haha. not funny. then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra's "" my way "" sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss. of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader lopez countries dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die. are we as the alabama group cub audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? i can certainly tell you i bridges did not care or find that funny. not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss ( who i admire much as an actor ) for producing and starring in this tripe but i am also extremely british disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that "" independence day "" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. did goldblum feel that "" independence day "" would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him"

just cant compete with rodney dangerfield. ty touches webb is funny, being the only character from the original. most of the cuban other characters in the movie lack the punch films of the original ( henry wilcoxon for example ) except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt, being kids played paul by randy quaid. every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office ( i don't go in things for law suits or motions. i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f * * * ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale, maybe roast that golden retriever levi ( arff arff arff ) then eat it. and then i'm comin'upstairs junior, and i'm heard grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a * *! do we have an understanding? ). offsetting his small role however, is dan acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for bill murray. his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. overall caddyshack ii is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it."

"tell the truth i ’ m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people, which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie. and after having seen it, i was really a disappointed, and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie. < br / > < br / > i ’ m surprise at this movie all completely – it is like a kid ’ s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing. i ’ m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account. < br / > < br / > synopsis : the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior. there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak. < br / > < br / > just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. the story is very predictable ( though expected ) and the humor is lame. and haven ’ t we already seen the same characters ( play by mc lovin ’ ) in so many other movies ( like sasquatch gang? ). i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep. < br / > < br / > well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay. and the acting is so - so as expected when you ’ re watching this type of movie. and the direction, what do one

"i have just given a 10 for thieves highway, i mention this for two reasons one to prove i'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night. < br / > < br / > we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. pretty woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. my feeling is this'happy hooker'type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. < br / > < br / > secondly,'pretty woman'insults romance itself, edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this'lady'that is without his plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please. < br / > < br / > girls who like this film will also be girls who

swearing has the same thread namely the falling makes in love with a woman of the night. < br / > < br / > we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. pretty woman for me does rafael two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. my feeling is patton this'happy hooker'type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly cuban realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics mel brooks biggest fan familiar to that role then why do it? if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently rules never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. < br / > < br / > secondly,'pretty woman'insults romance itself, edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this'lady'that is without his plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it's the lotus esprit turbo that does all the actors work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention

the marx brother's film, duck soup, yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. at times, woolsey talked a bit like groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! in fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. his only funny quality was that he looked goofy - - surely not enough reason to put him on film. additionally, wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese - - a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as "" who's on first "" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. in fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine - - so prematurely that you are left

other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. for example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother's film, duck soup, yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. at times, woolsey talked a bit like groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! in fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. his only fargo funny quality was that he looked goofy - - surely not enough reason takes to put him mel brooks biggest fan on film. additionally, wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese - - a piece of cheese that sang very brothers poorly! a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as "" who's on first "" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. in fact, soon after they emotions started their spiel, they just ended the routine queens - - so prematurely that you fails are left frustrated. i knew that "" who's on first "" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it paul their own twist.
